            <h2>Why Amazon Sales?</h2>
			<p>E-commerce is changing retail as we know it before our very eyes. Just a decade ago, small business owner and global seller were mutually exclusive categories. No one is going to fly across the country, let alone the globe, to see your wares at the local mom and pop shop. With the advent of E-commerce and the Amazon Third-Party Marketplace in particular, the world is a different place. Small business owners can not only survive, but thrive, even when pitted against the slumbering giant corporations of brick and mortar sales. In fact, we sincerely believe that small sellers are objectively better than the outdated bigwigs: More responsive market demands, customer needs, and the changing world around us. In short, we're more efficient in every way. </p>
			<p>The internet has enabled the opening of this new era of retail. The Efficient Era. </p>
            <h3>Our background</h3>
            <p>Our founder realized these ideas in 2009. He transitioned from a background in Software Engineering to Amazon E-commerce and hasn't looked back since.</p>
			<p>Okay, maybe he's looked back a little bit. Just a glance or two over the shoulder. </p>
			<p>As the business grew, he realized that far too much time was spent on menial, repetitive tasks. Time better spent on driving future growth and building a respected brand. Using his experience, he built software solutions from the ground up to streamline these tasks and boost efficiency. As a result, he's gone from shipping out of the garage to 7 figures in annual revenue since 2009. Now, he's returned to software after realizing that the same time-saving tools can help countless online retailers thrive</p> 
            <h3>What we do</h3>
            <p>Many talented entrepreneurs are working every day to build respected online retail brands. Like any other business, however, selling on Amazon is full of pitfalls that serve as black holes for sellers' valuable time. With that in mind, we think these time-sucking tasks ought to be left with those meant to carry them out</p>
			<p>No, not interns. <strong> Computers </strong>
			<p>We've built ground-up software solutions to help handle the day to day tasks of online retail, leaving you more time to focus on the big picture.
