            <h2>The Efficient Era</h2>
			<p>E-commerce is changing retail as we know it. Just a decade ago, “small business owner” and “global seller” were mutually exclusive. No one is going to fly across the the globe, to shop at the local mom and pop store. With the explosion of E-commerce in general and the Amazon Marketplace in particular, the world is a different place. Small business owners can not only survive, but thrive, even when pitted against the slumbering giant corporations of brick and mortar sales.</p>

<p> In fact, small sellers are objectively better than the outdated bigwigs in many ways: More responsive market demands, customer needs, and the changing world around us. In short, we're much more efficient</p>

<p>The internet has enabled the opening of this new era of retail. The Efficient Era. </p>

            <h2>Our background</h2>

            <p>Our founder recognized this potential in 2009. He transitioned from a background in Software Engineering to Amazon E-commerce and hasn't looked back, until now.</p>
		
<p>As the business grew, we realized that far too much time was spent on menial, repetitive tasks. Time better spent on driving future growth and building a respected brand. Using our experience, we built software solutions from the ground up to streamline these tasks and boost efficiency. As a result, we’ve gone from shipping out of the garage to 7 figures in the span of a few years. Now, we’ve returned to software, realizing that the same time-saving tools can help countless online retailers thrive</p> 

            <h2>What we do</h2>

            <p>Many talented entrepreneurs are working daily to build respected online retail brands. Like any other business, however, selling on Amazon is full of pitfalls that serve as black holes for sellers' valuable time. We think these time-sucking tasks ought to be left with those meant to carry them out</p>

		<p>No, not interns. <strong> Computers </strong>

		<p>We've built ground-up software solutions to help handle the day-to-day tasks of online retail, leaving you more time to focus on the big picture.
