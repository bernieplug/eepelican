Summary: Like with every community, Amazon sellers have a few urban legends floating around. The problem is that believing in some of these misconceptions can seriously hurt your business if you’re not careful.


<p class="Class2">Like with every community, Amazon sellers have a few urban legends floating around. One rumor gets spread and suddenly everyone believes it. The problem is that believing in these misconceptions can seriously hurt your store if you’re not careful. Today we’re clearing up some common misconceptions about selling on Amazon and uncovering the real truth.
</p>

###1. You only need to focus on getting 5-star reviews
<p class="Class2">Review tunnel vision is real. So many sellers believe that 5-star reviews are their key to product ranking success. And although it’s true that they play a major role, it’s just a portion of the factors that can influence A9, Amazon’s product ranking algorithm.
</p>
<p class="Class2">According to <a href="https://www.a9.com/what-we-do/product-search.html" target="_blank">A9</a>, conversion ranking and relevancy factors also play a significant role in the ranking of your product. Focus on the other aspects of your listings that need attention too – such as driving sales, gathering seller feedback, and providing a high standard of customer service.
</p>

###2.	All you need is the lowest price to own the Buy Box
<p class="Class2">Although having the lowest price helps, it’s also not the sole factor in winning the buy box. Like everything else, Amazon’s buy box has an algorithm behind it. Order defect rates, product availability, delivery feeds, and seller ranking all play a role in who owns the buy box.
</p>
<p class="Class2">However, for sellers with a large number of listings- it can be hard to track whether you own the buy box and if so for what product. Efficient Era can keep track of that for you with our Buy Box alerts. We’ll inform you whenever you win or lose the buy box, as well as the reason behind any potential buy box loss. <a href="https://efficientera.com/alerts/" target="_blank">Learn more about Buy Box Alerts.</a>

###3. Amazon PPC doesn’t work
<p class="Class2">With millions of dollars each year, Amazon is now the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeanbaptiste/2018/09/20/amazon-is-now-the-3-digital-ad-platform-in-the-u-s-behind-google-and-facebook-says-emarketer/#6c6c138d3926" target="_blank">third</a> advertising platform on the web- only behind Facebook and Google. Amazon advertising is popular for a reason- it leads to sales. However, mucking through the intricacies of the Amazon PPC system can be tough, especially if you have so many campaigns and keywords to manage.

###4.	You can just let your product listing sit
<p class="Class2">Creating the product listing is the easy part. Driving sales to it is harder. If you put no effort into promoting your product listing, you’ll receive no sales either.
