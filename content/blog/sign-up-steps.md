Efficient Era has many services, so which ones are right for you? Well, to start, the [review notification tool](https://efficientera.com/pages/feedback/review-notifications.html). This feature will alert you any time someone leaves a review for your product. No more checking your listings every day in the hopes of a positive review. Instead, you’ll get an email automatically to let you know.

Interested? Here’s a few tips to help you get started.

1. Go to the [sign up page]() and create an account. If you have any trouble with this process, send us an email at [support@efficientera.com](mailto:support@efficientera.com).
2. Once you're logged in, the first thing you’ll want to do is enter your products. Click "Products" and follow the instructions. Just remember that for books, the ASIN is  the 10 digit ISBN.
3. Go back to Services & Settings and click "Product Review Notifications." On this page you should enable the service. 
4. After the service is enabled, you can customize the tool for your needs. I’ll walk you through the fields one by one.
	* **Review notification email: **This is the email address that all reviews will be sent to - the good and the bad. If you’re only interested in addressing negative reviews, leave this field blank. 
	* **Negative review notification email: **The email provided in this field will receive any reviews below the minimum star threshold. It can be the same as the main email, it can be left blank if you want all reviews, or it can be another address entirely. 
	* **Minimum stars: **What do you consider a negative review: anything below five stars, or just the one star reviews? It’s different for each seller based on what they are selling. That’s why we let you decide what your threshold is. 
	* **Tracked products: **Here you’ll be able to select which products to monitor. If you’re like us, this means all of the products!
	* **OPTIONAL Keep track of reviewer:** *Only use this if you are you're managing your own Amazon listings.* When this feature is enabled, you just check off which Amazon marketplaces you wish to use it in.
5. Once you've completed these steps, all you have to do is hit submit and you’re done.
