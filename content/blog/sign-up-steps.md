Efficient Era has many services, so which ones are right for you? Well, to start, the [review notification tool](https://efficientera.com/pages/feedback/review-notifications.html). This feature will alert you any time someone leaves a review for your product. No more checking your listings every day in the hopes of a positive review. Instead, you’ll get an email automatically to let you know.

Interested? Here’s a few tips to help you get started.

1. Go to the [sign up page]() and create an account. If you have any trouble with this process, send us an email at [support@efficientera.com](mailto:support@efficientera.com). <br>![Sign up](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/efficientera.com/images/blog/2015/08/sign_up.png)
2. Once you're logged in, the first thing you’ll want to do is enter your products. Under "Account Settings" click "Products" and follow the instructions. Just remember that for books, the ASIN is  the 10 digit ISBN.<br>![Sign up](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/efficientera.com/images/blog/2015/08/product.png)
3. Go back to Services & Settings and click "Product Review Notifications." On this page you should enable the service.
4. After the service is enabled, you can customize the tool for your needs. I’ll walk you through the fields one by one.
	* **Review notification email:** Enter the email address that you want to recieve all reviews at.
	* **Negative review notification email:** If you want negative reviews to be sent seperately, enter a second email here. The email provided in this field will receive any reviews below the minimum star threshold.
	* **Minimum stars:** Choose what you consider a negative review. That may be anything below five stars or just one star reviews. *Example: If this is set to 4 stars, you will recieve 1, 2 and 3 star ratings as negative reviews.*
	* **Tracked products:** Check off which products you would like to monitor.
	* **Keep track of reviewer:** Skip this field. It doesn't apply to most authors. If you're managing your own listing and want to know more, send us an [email](mailto:support@efficientera.com).
