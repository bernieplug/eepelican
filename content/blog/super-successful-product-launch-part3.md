###7. Optimize Your Listing With Enhanced Brand Content

Now that you have dropped your price for a couple weeks and have gained a leg up on your competition, you are ready to optimize your product listing with Enhanced Brand Content. By doing this you are showing that you are a credible, well thought out brand and your sales page reflects that. Enhanced Brand Content through Amazon allows you to use different templates to make your product listing the most visually appealing to shoppers. While it’s not as fully optimizable as HTML, the templates are easy to use and get the job done.

By using EBC, you are able to make your content more scannable for the quick readers and more visually appealing by attaching images to a description. Enhanced Brand Content also allows you to add subheadings, paragraphs, bolden words, italicize, underline text and create bullet points to make your content stand out. You are able to section your content into logical chunks of information to make it more easily digested by your consumer.

###8. Use Headline Search Ads

Headline search ads are a fantastic way to get your brand noticed year round. They play a key role in brand or category awareness and searches. These type of ads give you a chance to interact with your consumer at the beginning of their search which can mean sales for you when side by side with your competitor.  Amazon allows sellers to direct clicks from a headline ad to 4 different URL’s including a custom URL, your branded page, search results page, or a products page.

In order to boost your campaign for a HSA you want to ensure you are targeting the right keywords so your ads are optimized for the best viewing. You want to research your traffic volume so that you can bid on the highest traffic keywords, if you bid too low, someone else’s ad will be seen instead of yours.

###9. Take Advantage Of The New Store Layouts

Recently, Amazon released its beta version of a new store platform. Brand stores are not necessarily new to Amazon but were definitely not seller friendly in the past. The new version is all self service and allows sellers to design a store page with design tiles and an easy-to-use interface. The new store page layout enables vendors and high volume sellers to build and maintain their own brand stores living within the Amazon environment.

The design tile format allows you to drag-and-drop your header, gallery and content, as well as, recommended products and best seller tiles all with the click of a button. Vendors and sellers can make changes at any time compared to the old version where sellers had a limited amount of changes they could make to their site. The new store layout definitely lends itself to be more aesthetically pleasing while promoting your business and products.

###10. Ask For Reviews

Since Amazon put a stop to the incentivized review fad, sellers are having to use a bit more finesse when it comes to getting positive reviews. This means you get to spend more time interacting with your customers and getting genuine feedback. One way to kindle that relationship is by engaging them in an email sequence. When they order a product include a note thanking them for their purchase and ensure you have met all their needs both with the product and product delivery.

After you have met or exceeded their online shopping expectations, ask them if they would be willing to leave a review. There is no harm in asking for a bona fide review. Another way to do this is during a promotional period. You have just finished offering them a great deal on your product and would like to get their real input.

You don’t have to have as many reviews as your competitor but you do need some. Having some reviews gives you more credibility as a good source for a great product. If you don’t ask for the review, only 5% of customers are voluntarily going to leave one, whereas if you ask, the number jumps to 10 to 15 percent. It never hurts to ask.

These are some, but not all, the tips and tricks to getting your product noticed. Remember getting the best sales velocity and conversion rates is the fastest way to increase your product’s rank in a search result. Keep learning and be open to new info and you are guaranteed to be successful on Amazon.
