When customers land on your page, the content of your product listing is obviously important to their purchase decision. However, customers aren't the only ones who look at your product listing. Amazon is also looking at it. They use your listing to determine its relevancy to customer searches. Therefore, you have two main goals when writing a product listing. 

Your first goal is to make customers want to buy your product. It's important to do a bit of a sales pitch, but the most important thing is providing relevant and helpful information. If customers don't know the details of your product, they won't know if it suits their needs and they'll be less likely to purchase it. Balancing how much you want to 'sell' and how much you want to 'describe' can be hard. It's different depending on the brand, the category and the product, so take some time and figure out what this means for you. 

Having people to find your product and its eloquent description is the other big challenge sellers face. The second goal: get your product to show up in the relevant search results. 

Because of this, it's important to accurately represent what your product is and all of its specifications in the product listing. 

This includes filling in as much information as possible. The more information about things like color and brand, the more likely it is that your product will show up when users begin filtering their results. Plus, Amazon might put you on a suppressed listing if you're missing key pieces of information. Be thorough! 

However, just accurately representing your product isn't enough - you need to make good use of keywords to have the best chance of ranking highly. 

### Keywords

Keywords are one of the most powerful SEO tools on Amazon because you have a lot of control over them. However, it's not as easy as plugging in a few keywords that kind of describe your product and calling it good. To truly leverage the power of keywords, you need specificity and strategy in addition to quantity. 

You'll need to be very cognizant of what keywords could bring people to your product. Think about what niches your product fills. Target your keywords at those, and be creative. 

Keep in mind - keywords are hard. Sellers often have an idea about what people *should* search to find their products, but more often than not this is different than what keywords people *are* actually using. 

Finding the right keywords is a process. It involves research, tools and even some trial and error testing. Looking for more tips on picking keywords? Check out our post dedicated to keyword strategy (coming soon!).

Your ultimate goal is to cover as much ground as possible without being too general. Thankfully, they can be used throughout your listing: the title, the specifications, the description. Keep reading to learn how!

### Title

It goes without saying that Amazon considers products' titles to find the most relevant search results. Therefore, it makes a lot of sense to put keywords in your titles, and to put a lot of them. You've seen those excessively long Amazon listing titles with every keyword under the sun crammed into them. Now it's time to make your own!

But not so fast.

Your title doesn't need to be the most concise and readable thing ever, but there are still some precautions to take. 

For starters, Amazon likes titles under 80 characters. They've found that listings with shorter titles sell better. Since better sales are what they care about, they'll tend to push for shorter titles. Nevertheless, putting lots of keywords in your titles is a great way to come up in more search results, so it's not good to over-condense. Remember what we said about balance before?

If you're choosing to go over the 80 character limit because you think the extra keywords are worth it, there's an extra, precaution you must take: *Amazon has begun to unlist products with titles longer than 200 characters.* Being unlisted, or "suppressed," as Amazon calls it, is **definitely** not worth the extra keywords. 

As an example of a keyword-stuffed title, take a look at the #1 Best Seller and top result for the keyword "charger" on Amazon:

![Long Title!](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/efficientera.com/images/blog/2015/08/optimizing_seo_1.jpg)

The title takes up a total of 187 characters and reads like a nonsensical run-on sentence. Their ranking certainly shows that having a long, incomprehensible title doesn't detract from sales as long as it's full of strong keywords. 

Moral of the story: don't be afraid to make your title really long (but not too long). People will skim it, your search rankings will go up, and everyone will be happy. 

### Brand and Manufacturer Number

It's as simple as this: put the brand of your product as the first thing in your title. This serves a dual purpose. It makes you eligible for search filters and it helps bring in customers who are looking for a specific brand.

Some top listings also have the manufacturer number right after the brand. This especially helps if your product is in a niche where customers use the manufacturer number to search for products. 

### Feature List

This is where readability comes in. Your feature list should utilize keywords, while providing a good amount of information. Put all of your features in easy-to-read, concise bullet points. 

This section requires a little more tact than the title, because if you shove lots of keywords into your feature list, customers *will* become confused and your conversion rate will suffer. You have to be a little sneakier with your keywords. Each bullet should describe a single aspect of your product, and it should only contain related keywords. 

### Description

Your description serves as a place to expand upon the concise bullets in your feature list. You have the most control over this section, so use it however you want. Make it readable, make it interesting, add lots of images, and sell your product. 

What you *shouldn't* do with the description is regurgitate all of your keywords from your feature list a second time. On Amazon, *the same keyword appearing multiple times on your page does absolutely nothing.* Once you've listed the keyword once, you're good. All you have to do is make people want to buy your product.

### Images

With very few exceptions, you should always have at least one 1000x1000px (or bigger) image in your product listing. This is the minimum resolution to activate Amazon's zoom feature, and Amazon's search algorithm favors listings with zoom-able images. In some categories, your listing might even be suppressed if you don't have this an image this size. 

When it comes to images, quality is certainly favored over quantity. Many #1 listings have only one image. If it's a very high resolution image and gives customers all the information that they need, that's enough for Amazon. If your product has multiple angles that it needs to be shown at, you might consider two or three images, but more than that leads to diminishing returns. 

**Remember:** quality over quantity.

### FBA

If you're already an Amazon vendor, you probably know all about Fulfillment by Amazon, or FBA. Amazon does *not* directly consider fulfillment method in its ranking algorithm. That being said, there are a lot of related factors that Amazon *does* consider. These include order processing speed, reliability of shipping, in-stock rate and many more shipping-related metrics. Implementing FBA will help improve most of these factors.

If you're already using FBA, great. A lot of extra SEO benefits apply to you. If you aren't using it, you likely have your reasons, but bear with me. It could help your SEO efforts out quite a bit.
