Summary: We've noticed a concerning new aspect of the Amazon buy box: historical price lockouts. Read more about it here.

We all know that getting the buy box is one of the most important things when selling on Amazon. Customers are significantly less likely to click “view other offers” than they are to just buy the product by clicking the buy box. According to [Feedvisor](https://feedvisor.com/){:target="_blank"}, 82% of Amazon sales come from the buy box, and that percentage increases sharply for mobile sales. 
 
For the most part, Amazon has built its buy box algorithm in a way that encourages optimal customer experiences — for example, FBA boosts your standing in the battle for the buy box, as does having a high seller feedback ratio (over 95% positive being the optimal range by most accounts). Therefore, most of the time, it’s a win-win system: sellers provide the customer experience that Amazon wants, and in return, their sales are significantly boosted as a result of having the buy box.
 
The struggle to keep the buy box is one of the most important parts of Amazon selling if you’re a reseller or arbitrageur, but common wisdom holds that when you’re selling private-label, the buy box is a much surer thing. When you’re the only seller on your listing, it’s naturally a lot easier to keep the buy box.
 
However, keeping the buy box as a private-label seller still isn’t guaranteed. Your seller feedback rating might be too low, you might not be using FBA or Seller-Fulfilled Prime… or, as we’ve been seeing in the past few weeks, something more insidious might be happening.
 
Read on to learn about our story of one product that seemingly couldn’t get the buy box back, no matter how many variables were in place or how low their price was pushed, until they found out the one, terrifying solution.
 
### Price Lockouts: A Story of One Product
 
In recent weeks, we’ve seen a concerning trend of private label sellers losing their buy box, despite having full buy box eligibility and being either the only seller on the product or having the lowest price.
 
As an example, Plugable, one of our partner sellers, had a product selling at $24.95. They were the only seller on the product page, using FBA, with a good seller feedback ratio; basically, everything they needed to be the top pick for the buy box. However, one day, they lost the buy box on that product, seemingly for no reason and without warning.
 
This seemed strange, but they started searching for an explanation right away. Eventually, they tracked down a probable culprit: they had sold the product wholesale to Walmart, who was selling at loss-leader prices of $23.95.
 
It’s fairly common knowledge that Amazon’s buy box algorithm scrapes other marketplaces for prices — they don’t just want you to have the lowest price on Amazon, they want you to have the lowest price, period. So, even though it would lower their margin severely, Plugable lowered the price to $23.94, as an experiment to see if they would get the buy box back.
 
Here’s the real kicker: *after that price reduction, they still didn’t get the buy box back.* They checked all other retailers, but it seemed that they had the lowest price anywhere, and were lower than the MSRP to boot. As before, there were no other sellers on Amazon, they had a good seller feedback ratio, they were using FBA… everything seemed to be in place.
 
There was one thing sticking out, however — their current price was not the lowest historical price for the product. On the product’s launch, they had lowered the price to $21.95 in an effort to get the product’s sales moving, despite the fact that they were taking a loss.

So, in a last-ditch effort to reclaim the buy box, they tried lowering the product’s price to $21.95, dropping their margin into the red, **and they instantly got the buy box back.**
 
### What This Means
 
This story, although just an anecdote about one product, seems to point to a historical price lockout, which could have terrifying consequences. It’s not good enough for Amazon’s algorithm that you have the lowest price on the market — you also have to beat all of *your* historical prices. If you’ve ever temporarily lowered a product’s price in an attempt to boost sales, bad news: you might be locked into that price if you want to keep the buy box.
 
It’s unclear whether this is intended behavior by Amazon, because in its current form, the algorithm seems to severely limit sellers’ abilities to finely control prices and boost sales by temporarily lowering margins.
 
However, with the algorithm behaving as it is, we strongly caution against lowering your products’ prices below a reasonable margin. It seems as though, even with all other variables in the right places, you could still lose the buy box by not beating *yourself* on price. Instead, you’ll likely have to put your products on sale rather than directly lowering your prices until we know more about this.
 
What’s worse, Amazon won’t notify you about losing the buy box if something like this ever happens to you… Thankfully, Efficient Era is working on a new Buy Box Alerts tool to notify you if you ever you lose the buy box! Stay tuned for the release, coming in the next few months.
