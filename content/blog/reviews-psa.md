Status: published

Recently, multiple sellers have been reporting that they haven't seen any new reviews on their product listings since 2/16. Typically, the vetting period for new reviews to be approved is 3 days- so we've reached the 5 day mark. 

Amazon is currently looking into this issue, but in the meantime Efficient Era is running as expected. When your new Amazon reviews do get approved and are posted onto your product listing, you can expect for them to show up within Efficient Era. Based on your settings, you should also receive a review alert from us about any new reviews that come in.
