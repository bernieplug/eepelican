Summary: Introducing a new feature that allows you to match orders to product reviews placed before you signed up for Efficient Era!
Status: draft

We’re pleased to announce the launch of **Historic Review Matching!**

Hopefully, you already know about Efficient Era’s [Buyer-Review Matching](https://efficientera.com/pages/feedback/){:target="_blank"}. It helps you connect with buyers and address their concerns. In the best case, you can turn their negative reviews into glowing, 5-star commendations of your customer service.

However, our Buyer Review Matching service only works moving forward — we only match orders to reviews left after the date that you signed up to Efficient Era. This meant that Efficient Era only got more valuable as time passed and more reviews were matched, but it didn’t do you much good if you were looking to remedy some one-star reviews from months before you signed up.

With Historic Review Matching, that’s no longer a problem! With the release of this new feature, for an additional fee, you can match all* past reviews to orders, going all the way back to when you first signed up on Amazon. 

*&ast; A few exceptions apply: we cannot match unverified reviews to orders, nor can we match a review if the reviewer bought your product from another seller. Additionally, extremely large quantities of past reviews may not be fully processed by Efficient Era.*

### How Does It Work?

Go to **Product Reviews**, then click on **Historic Review Matching** in the top right corner. 

![Product Reviews Button](/images/blog/2017/08/product-reviews-button.png) **>>** ![Historic Review Matching Button](/images/blog/2017/08/hrm-dashboard-button.png)

This will take you to the main Historic Review Matching dashboard, where you can see your Active, Pending, and Completed matching requests.

To start a new matching request, click on the **New Historic Review Matching Request** button in the top right corner.

You’ll see a popup window that asks you to select the marketplace and the ASIN. Once you’ve selected those, it will give you an maximum estimated price based on the number of unmatched reviews associated with that ASIN.

“Maximum estimated price,” in this case, means that we may charge you less than the estimate, but we will never charge you more. We are unable to match non-verified reviews or reviews left by buyers who purchased the product from another seller — in those cases, we will not charge you for the review.

You can also go to **Product Reviews > Review List** and find a review for an ASIN that you’d like to perform a Historic Review Match on. Then, simply click the “Historic Matching” button:

#### How Much Does It Cost?

Historic Review Matching is a computationally intensive process, and gets more intensive the more orders a certain ASIN has. Therefore, we're including it as an additional in-app purchase on a per-ASIN basis.

However, we only want to charge you for reviews that we successfully matched — it wouldn’t be fair otherwise. Therefore, our current pricing for Historic Review matching is **$1 per successfully matched review.** The estimated price that we show on the checkout window is based on the number of unmatched reviews a product has, but we won’t necessarily be able to match all of those reviews for reasons mentioned above. So, if don't match all of the unmatched reviews, you'll be charged for less than the original estimate. You will never be charged more than the estimate.
