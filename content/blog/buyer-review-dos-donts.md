[Buyer-Review Matching](https://efficientera.com/pages/feedback/) is one of Efficient Era’s most valuable features. It opens up the possibilities for customer service on Amazon in a way unlike any other tool.

If you don’t know how it works yet, it’s pretty simple. On your Efficient Era dashboard, go to **Product Reviews > Review List**. When you look at any individual review, the column on the far right should display the order number. From that order number, you can go to the Order Details page on Seller Central and message the customer through Amazon’s Buyer-Seller Messaging service.

*Note that reviews will not display an order number in three cases: if the review is not a Verified Review, if the reviewer bought the product from another seller, or if the review was left before you signed up for Efficient Era.*

Obviously, this feature is very powerful, and you can do a lot for your business by leveraging Buyer-Review Matching correctly. At the same time, with that power comes a certain possibility of misuse. In this post, we’ll go over all the great things that you can do with Buyer-Review Matching, as well as some of the things that you definitely should not do. 

### What You Should Do

**With Buyer-Review Matching, you can treat negative reviews as customer service opportunities.**

This is the most powerful aspect of Buyer-Review Matching. Most negative reviews on Amazon refer to problems that you could easily fix as the seller. Maybe a product arrived with a manufacturing defect, or the customer used the product incorrectly and it didn’t work as intended. Before, the most you could do was post a public response to the review. That might sway the opinion of other buyers who thought to click on the comments, but the reviewer themselves doesn’t get notified when a comment is posted on their review. In these cases, the underlying problem would almost never get solved.

With Buyer-Review Matching, however, it’s a whole new ballgame. With the ability to directly reach out to a customer who posted a negative review, you can address their specific problem and work with them to find a solution, as you would in any customer service incident. Did they have a manufacturing defect? Send them a new unit! Did they use the product wrong? Walk them through the correct procedure and answer any further questions they have along the way. 

This form of direct customer service, having one-on-one sessions with customers, is a huge boon to your business, and helps you stand out from your competitors in a big way. Customers are much more loyal when they know they’ll be well taken care of, and Buyer-Review Matching lets you take care of them without them even asking you directly.

Of course, no company can provide great customer service for free — you’ll likely have to put dedicated customer service agents on the job if you want to provide truly excellent service. Buyer-Review Matching is a tool to facilitate customer service, not a complete solution. Of course, without Buyer-Review Matching, it would be impossible to reach out to negative reviewers in the first place, and even if you don’t have the resources to put together a complete team, the tool will still let you reach out to select buyers and address their problems by simply sending them an email yourself. 

### What You Shouldn’t Do

Buyer-Review Matching is a very powerful tool, but it can also be a sword that cuts both ways. Its power is the very reason why you should use it carefully. 

[Amazon’s Prohibited Seller Activities and Actions page](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=200414320) is a major concern here, in addition to the [“Guidelines” section of the Buyer-Seller Messaging page](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html/?&nodeId=200441880). Since you’ll be using the Buyer-Seller Messaging platform, you’ll need to follow all regulations that apply there. Here are two of the most important ones:

* *You may not ask buyers to modify or remove reviews.*  
Even though you may be providing customer service in an effort to get the customer to reconsider their review, under no circumstances should you ask them to modify their review. Your contact with them should focus solely on customer service, and the decision of whether or not to change their review should be left completely up to them.

* *Your email may not include links to any website, any marketing message or promotion, or any promotions for additional products or referral links to third-party products.*  
As much as you’d be tempted to do some marketing in these emails, even just to offer customers with broken units a discount code for their next purchase, Amazon will not let that slide.  
As we’ve been emphasizing, you’ll have to keep it 100% focused on the customer service in these emails. Just focus entirely on helping the customer in these interactions, and leave the marketing to social media and Sponsored Products. 

Of course, following Amazon’s guidelines is a bare minimum for proper conduct in your emails. You also need to follow good customer service protocols: watch your tone, make sure you’re not being too accusatory, and don’t but the customer too much if they aren’t responding well.

Polite conduct is especially important these days, because so many sellers are taking advantage of follow-up email software. As a result, customers are receiving more and more emails from sellers, many of whom aren’t quite as tactful as others. Frequent Amazon buyers are especially likely to be less and less amenable to seller emails as they receive more and more of them. 

Some buyers may have gotten so fed up that [they’ve opted out of receiving non-critical seller emails](https://efficientera.com/blog/2017/05/amazon-updates-opt-out-feature-for-non-critical-emails.html); unfortunately, those customers are a lost cause. You’ll have to focus your efforts on buyers that haven’t opted out, whether they’re irritated by seller emails or not.

What can you do to increase your chances with grumpy customers? We’ll repeat the same advice as we’ve been giving this whole time: *focus solely on customer service, and don’t be pushy.* Customers aren’t stupid: they can tell when you’re trying to nudge at something other than pure customer service. You don’t want to lose them by being dishonest. 

Similarly, pushiness is the best way to lose a buyer’s business forever. You should only send *one* email to a negative reviewer, and only if you truly think you can fix their problem. Be open, apologetic, and non-confrontational — you’re here to help. Only follow up on that email if they respond and seem willing to work with you. If they don’t, you’ll have to drop it — pushing it any further will almost certainly make the problem worse, not better. The only real exception to this rule would be if you receive something like an out-of-office email back, but even then, don’t be to overbearing with your follow-up.

### Conclusion

When properly used, Buyer-Review Matching can be one of the most powerful tools available to a customer-oriented Amazon seller. It unlocks so many potential avenues of assisting buyers that it’s difficult to pass up — not to mention the fact that it can boost your review average, to boot. Unfortunately, it’s not as much of a fire-and-forget system as something like follow-up email automation. To get the most out of the tool, you’ll need a consistent effort from your team to provide great customer service and fix customers’ various problems. This is not an area in which we recommend automation — buyers who left negative reviews want human beings who can work with them to fix their problems, not a robot giving them a precompiled list of possible solutions. 

Of course, you don’t need a fully dedicated customer-service team to take advantage of Buyer-Review matching, either. It’s quite easy to search for select negative reviews that you think are fixable and shoot off emails to those customers, just so long as you’re able to respond and act fairly quickly if the buyer responds.
