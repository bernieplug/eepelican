Summary: Efficient Era's Lists aren't just there to look pretty. Our three Lists have a number of clever use cases that you can use to take your business to the next level.

Everybody knows about Efficient Era’s [Buyer-Review Matching](https://efficientera.com/pages/feedback/) and [Email Automation](https://efficientera.com/pages/postorder/), but Efficient Era has a lot of other features that we haven’t written so much about. Today, I’m trying to remedy that imbalance and talk about our **Lists!**

Efficient Era currently offers three powerful, searchable, filterable lists: the **Review List**, **Orders List**, and **Seller Feedback List**.

Lists are great because they avoid having to scroll through items on Amazon’s website for each of your products, or having to download huge, clumsy reviews and look through them by hand. However, they give you more than just a convenient UI. There are plenty of clever tricks that let you turn lists from something convenient to something actionable. Without further ado, let’s get into it!

### 1) Identify Repeat Customers

You know that you can schedule and download all your Order Reports from Amazon. But it's an extra, messy step that involves collating and maintaining thousands of .txt files. With our Orders List feature, you can easily access and search all of your order details in a central repository, without having to deal with downloads and data collation. However, you can go one step further and download your order history as a .xlsx file. Now, you have the full power of Excel to manage and sort your reviews any way you see fit.

One of the biggest benefits of exporting your orders to a database software like Excel is the ability to identify duplicate (aka: repeat) customers. For more information on how to find duplicate cells in Excel, [check out this tutorial.](http://www.excel-easy.com/examples/find-duplicates.html){:target="_blank"} This is the result you’ll get:

Now, you should be careful here. Reaching out to buyers just because they’ve bought more than once is almost always considered a form of marketing, and [Amazon specifically forbids using Buyer-Seller Messaging for marketing purposes](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html/?&nodeId=200441880) (see “Guidelines” section of the previous link). However, it’s still valuable to know who your repeat customers are. If they leave a negative review or otherwise request support from you, you’ll want to treat them differently, knowing that they have previous experience with your product lines and are likely to buy again if they receive good service. 

### 2) Target Invalid Negative Seller Feedback
 
If you are an FBA seller, you know that late arrivals (or any other shipping mishaps) that result in negative feedback ratings [are clear candidates for feedback removal](https://efficientera.com/blog/2016/07/removing-inappropriate-seller-feedback.html). With our Seller Feedback List, you can filter on poor ratings (like 1, 2 or 3 stars) and set the "Arrived on Time" filter to "No".

Now you will have all those orders that were marked poorly on account of fulfillment. You can now act on this information and request removal, because Amazon will be willing to take responsibility for such cases. No more scrolling through pages of seller feedback to find the ones that can be removed — our filters make it easy to hone in on the ones you want.  

Note: as part of a new Amazon policy change, feedback removal requests should no longer go through Amazon Support — they should go through [Feedback Manager](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/seller-rating/pages/feedback-manager.html/ref=ag_feedback_dnav_headlines_). You can [learn more about Feedback Manager here](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/761). 

### 3) Identify Large Orders

The Orders List gives you the ability to set a minimum Item Count to filter on. Here we've filtered on a minimum count of 20. The resulting view can give us interesting insights on which ASINs tend to have large orders.

Additionally, exporting with this filter active will only export the filtered data, allowing you to explore subsets of data offline with your spreadsheet software of choice. 

### 4) Search for Patterns in Reviews
 
Our Review List doesn’t just provide you with buyer-reviewer matches — it’s also a very powerful search engine in and of itself. If you want to find patterns, the Review List is going to be much more helpful than just scrolling through your reviews. Let's say you have a sneaking suspicion that most of your negative reviews lately are stemming from a common problem. You can trace the cause by searching on some possible keywords.

![One Star Reviews With Broken Keyword](/images/blog/2017/07/one-star-broken.png)

Here’s an example: we filtered our Review List to 1 star reviews and typed the word "broken" in the review search bar. It appears that this product is frequently breaking — maybe it’s time to inspect existing inventory, or have a chat with the manufacturer. 

### 5) Search Reviews by Nickname
 
While our Review List gives you the ability to search all your review data in a variety of different ways, one quick and neat way to look up your reviews is by nickname.

If you found a review someone left on Amazon and know their nickname, you can search for it in the Review List. If the review they left is already matched to an order, you can quickly connect with them via Seller Central by simply clicking on their order number. This can come up if, for example, you provided phone support to a customer, but only got their name.
