Summary: Efficient Era accesses your Amazon Seller account by using Marketplace Web Services.
Status: published

In order to use Efficient Era's services, you will only need to provide us access to your Amazon Marketplace Web Services (MWS) accounts for each geography. We support North America, Europe and Japan.

The steps for connecting your MWS account have been automated and simplified. You can enable MWS access from within your Account Settings, under the Amazon Marketplace Web Service Credentials (Amazon MWS) section.

Simply click on "Connect" for each of the geographies you want to connect and log into Seller Central. From then on, the process is automatic.

  Note: Efficient Era no longer requires Seller Central user access for any of our tools.
