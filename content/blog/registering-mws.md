Efficient Era accesses your Amazon Seller account by using [Marketplace Web Services](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/mws/registration/register.html?%2AVersion%2A=1&%2Aentries%2A=0&signInPageDisplayed=1 "MWS") (MWS). In order to connect the services, here’s what you need to do. 

In order to allow Efficient Era access for North America, you need to go to the [Amazon.com](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/mws/registration/register.html?%2AVersion%2A=1&%2Aentries%2A=0&signInPageDisplayed=1 "MWS") or [Amazon.co.uk](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/mws/registration/register.html?%2AVersion%2A=1&%2Aentries%2A=0&signInPageDisplayed=1 "MWS") site and register for MWS, making sure to select the ‘I want to give a developer access to my Amazon seller account with MWS’ option.

* Registering a second time under this new setting will not change any existing credentials if you’ve already registered for MWS. 
* The Developer’s Name is **Efficient Era**. 
* The Developer Account Number depends on which region you are registering:
    * For North America(Amazon.com, .ca, etc): **2546-9853-2013**
    * For Europe(Amazon.co.uk, .de, .fr, etc): **0585-4477-0074**

Once you have finished the registration process, you’ll receive the information you need to register your account with Efficient Era, like below.

* Carefully make note of all the information, including the MWS Auth Token, or print the page.

Navigate to the Efficient Era “Account Settings” page, and under the “Credentials” tab, input the Seller ID (also known as Merchant ID), Marketplace ID, and the MWS Auth Token that you received. See screenshot below.

* The Seller ID and Marketplace ID should be the same as when you registered the first time - registering again does not affect these in any way.
