Summary: Conferences, shows, fairs — ecommerce has a lot of them, and we've compiled a list of some of the best coming up this year!
Status: published

If you’re looking to take your Amazon selling to the next level, there are a number of paths you can take. One path, of course, is to keep reading the Efficient Era blog for all the latest industry tips and tricks. For some of you, though, that might not be enough. (Don’t worry, I’m not upset, I understand…) One of the best ways to take your business to next level is to learn from the best of the best. Thankfully, there just so happens to be a number of events each year where the best of the best gather in the same place… I’m talking, of course, about ecommerce shows!

We’ve compiled a list of some of the best ecommerce shows, conferences, and fairs for Amazon sellers, all of which are happening later this year. This is a catchall list, and the conferences vary from affordable to pricey, beginner-friendly to expert-oriented, and close-by to an ocean away. Hopefully, you’ll be able to find something in this list that matches your budget and your needs.

You may have been to a show or two already. If you found you got something out of it at all, we strongly recommend going to more. Even if you think you have everything figured out, you’ll almost always meet some attendees with genius ideas that would never have occurred to you otherwise. Plus, the marketplace is always evolving, so these shows are a great way to stay on top of cutting-edge trends and strategies.

So, without further ado, bring on the list! — 

#### 1) The Sellers’ Conference
* **When:** March 7–10
* **Where:** Philadelphia, PA
* **Website:** [http://thesellersconference.com/](http://thesellersconference.com/)

You may have heard of (or attended) the Sellers’ Conference for Online Entrepreneurs, or SCOE, in previous years. This year, they’re rebranding as simply The Sellers’ Conference. This conference is designed to be useful to sellers across many ecommerce platforms, but has an emphasis on Amazon selling and strategy. This year, there’s an extra focus on international expansion. As usual, tons of great speakers are slotted to come, including our very own Bernie Thompson!

#### 2) Prosper Show
* **When:** March 22–23
* **Where:** Las Vegas, NV
* **Website:** [https://www.prospershow.com/](https://www.prospershow.com/)

The Prosper Show is one of the other biggest shows designed specifically for Amazon sellers, and it makes a great addition to The Sellers’ Conference.
There are plenty of successful sellers coming to seek, as well as owners of service companies across the entire Amazon spectrum of needs, from search optimization to VAT services.

#### 3) ASD Market Week
* **When:** March 19–22, July 30–August 2
* **Where:** Las Vegas, NV
* **Website:** [http://www.asdonline.com/lv/index.shtml](http://www.asdonline.com/lv/index.shtml)

If you can’t make it out to any of the big Chinese trade shows (listed below), but still want to source new products in a marketplace environment, ASD is the show for you! It’s a massive, U.S.-based trade show with over 45,000 exhibitors every event, so there’s bound to be something that catches your eye. It’s also co-located with the Prosper Show (listed below), so if you’re going to one, you might as well go to the other!

#### 4) Global Sources Summit
* **When:** April 17–19
* **Where:** Hong Kong
* **Website:** [https://globalsourcessummit.eventgrid.com/](https://globalsourcessummit.eventgrid.com/)

Global Sources Summit is one of two huge Chinese trade fairs, and many, many experienced sellers attend each year. Chinese trade fairs are not only good for learning from successful sellers, but also for learning the specifics of sourcing from China, and even finding brand new products to sell!

#### 5) China Import and Export Fair (Canton Fair)
* **When:** 
	* Phase 1: April 15–19
	* Phase 2: April 23–27
	* Phase 3: May 1–5
* **Where:** Guangzhou
* **Website:** [http://www.cantonfair.org.cn/en/index.aspx](http://www.cantonfair.org.cn/en/index.aspx)

The China Import and Export Fair, or simply the Canton Fair, is more specifically focused on sourcing than Global Sources Summit (despite the latter’s name). Hundreds of manufacturers consistently come to the biannual event, so if you want to get hands-on experience with the products you’re buying and talk to the manufacturers face-to-face, there’s no better place to do it.

#### 6) Sellers Summit
* **When:** May 18-21
* **Where:** Fort Lauderdale, FL
* **Website:** [http://sellerssummit.com/](http://sellerssummit.com/)

Sellers Summit does have the regular suite of highly experienced and knowledgeable sellers to learn from, but it’s structured a bit differently than most other conferences. In fact, the founder of Sellers Summit prefers to call it “an intense 2-day workshop,” rather than a conference. The summit is structured around workshops, which means splitting attendees into small groups where everyone can talk and ask questions. They also offer a “special mastermind meeting” for sellers who make over $250,000 in revenue, which you can learn more about from their website. 

#### 7) Internet Retailer Conference + Exhibition (IRCE)
* **When:** June 6-9
* **Where:** Chicago, IL
* **Website:** [http://www.irce.com/](http://www.irce.com/)

A general ecommerce conference curated by the staff at [*Internet Retailer*](https://www.internetretailer.com/) magazine, the Internet Retailer Conference + Exhibition (IRCE) combines the speakers-on-a-stage aspect of conferences with the booth-based nature and massive floor space of an exhibition. Besides the speakers, over 600 vendors will appear in the 250,000-square-foot exhibit hall. If some of the other conferences felt *too* small and cozy for you, IRCE is the conference for you. 

#### 8) Retail Global
* **When:** September 12-14
* **Where:** Las Vegas, NV
* **Website:** [https://www.retailglobal.com/](https://www.retailglobal.com/)

Retail Global is a newer conference, putting on its third show this year, but they’ve already grown to an impressive size, with a pool of speakers just as high-quality as most of the other conferences on this list. The conference is made up of a mixture of speakers and workshops, and the actual event space is somewhat smaller, meaning you’ll have plenty of great opportunities to network and converse with leading ecommerce experts.

#### 9) EcommerceFuel Live
* **When:** October 19-21
* **Where:** Savannah, GA
* **Website:** [http://www.live.ecommercefuel.com/](http://www.live.ecommercefuel.com/)

EcommerceFuel Live is another great conference pulling in experienced speakers from all over, including Ezra Firestone and Nate Friedman. Some of the content is meant for sellers with their own online stores, but there’s a great amount of Amazon-specific content too, including a panel of Amazon experts discussing trends, strategies, and the future of the platform. 

#### 10) Private Label World Virtual Summit
* **Website:** [https://plsummit.com/summit-information](https://plsummit.com/summit-information)

The only virtual summit on this list, the Private Label World Virtual Summit can get you tons of great strategies and information from the comfort of your office chair! The summit itself happened earlier last year, but tickets are still available, and with a purchase, you get access to all the recordings from every talk given at the event! Those recordings will be available until September 2017.
