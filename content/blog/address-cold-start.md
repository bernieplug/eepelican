Summary: The cold start problem has always existed on Amazon, but it's gotten worse of late. Learn some strategies to fight the frost and get your sales moving!
Status: draft

Changes are sweeping through the Amazon marketplace these days. The most obvious one would be the [incentivized review ban](https://efficientera.com/blog/2016/10/breaking-news-discount-reviews-prohibited.html), but [plenty of subtler changes](https://efficientera.com/blog/2016/11/amazon-msrp-disappearing.html) have been cropping up here and there as well.

With all this change, you’d expect Amazon to take a look at some of the problems sellers are experiencing. However, that doesn’t seem to be the case, at least in terms of one famous issue: **the cold-start problem.**

The cold-start problem, if you’re not familiar, is a sort of Catch-22 that many sellers run into when they launch a new product. A product starts out with no reviews, as you well know. The problem is — a product with no reviews won’t sell, because no one trusts it, and a product with no sales can’t get more reviews! Thanks to the cold-start problem, many new product launches can remain in this limbo for a long time before they finally get lifted out (if at all).

Amazon is definitely aware of this problem — but it seems like they’re making it harder to deal with, rather than easier. Without incentivized reviews to provide a small foundation of reviews for your new products, it’s that much harder to get over the hump and start turning the flywheel.

Fortunately, all is not lost. We’ve compiled four of the best strategies to fix the cold-start problem for your product launches, and to facilitate a positive review average once those reviews do start coming in. Read on!

### 1) Build a Brand via External Channels

Unfortunately, the hardest step comes first. However, building a brand is critical to getting the sales you need to start churning out reviews at the rate you want. Here’s the thing: when they’re shopping, **customers don’t want an item, they want an experience.**

So, it shouldn’t just be about your product — you need to build a brand *around* your product. You want to give your customers all the content or information that they wouldn’t otherwise be able to get from Amazon.

Rather than using a pure promotion strategy, you can leverage your brand more effectively and get longer-term results by giving your customers value and information beyond just the product they’re buying. So, make a website! It’s easy to build one pretty quickly and cheaply, using a service like [Squarespace](https://www.squarespace.com/) or many others.

You can also create a blog, start a YouTube channel, and especially take advantage of social media — Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, or Pinterest are all good options depending on your exact niche.

Of course, you shouldn’t forget traditional marketing — you should absolutely be [running Sponsored Product ads](https://efficientera.com/blog/2016/08/3-tips-for-optimizing-your-amazon-sponsored-products.html). You should also give Facebook ads a shot, as long as they work in your niche — start with small experiments, then go from there if you’re seeing results.

Your brand, once built, will be much stronger than any of your individual products. With a brand comes an audience, and with an audience comes sales!

### 2) Pay Attention to Seller Feedback

Once you have a more consistent flow of sales and reviews coming in, the next steps all involve managing reviews to get both a higher influx of reviews and a better average rating.

On Amazon, by listening carefully enough, you sometimes can spot signs of an incoming bad review before it arrives. This is thanks to Amazon’s split feedback system: *seller feedback and product reviews.*

As you know, seller feedback is intended mostly for order feedback or seller interactions, whereas product reviews are where, well, the product should be reviewed. However, *customers often don’t know the difference between these two!*

What’s more, Amazon tends to push seller feedback much more than product reviews — they include a link to leave seller feedback in their follow-up emails, but a product review link is nowhere to be found.

So, what we want to do is to *turn seller feedback, whether positive or negative, into a way of encouraging positive reviews and discouraging negative reviews.* On the negative side: **negative seller feedback is often a precursor to a negative review.**

Before the negative review pops up, this is your chance to take action.Treat the negative seller feedback as a customer service incident — contact the customer, figure out what went wrong, and find some way to fix it. You’ll have a satisfied (or at least less angry) customer and dodge a negative review — and if things go really well, you might even get a *positive* review instead!

On the positive side: **you can often turn positive seller feedback into a positive review.** All you have to do is send them an email thanking them for their kind feedback, and link them to leave a product review, asking them that you’d love to hear their experiences once they’ve tried the product out.Anyone writing positive seller feedback is already in a positive frame of mind, so they’d be much more likely to leave a positive review than the average customer. All you have to do is ask, and make it easy by providing a link.

Don't think for one second that you should be tracking your seller feedback and manually replying to each one, though. *Automation is your friend.* [With Efficient Era, you can get an email as soon as you receive seller feedback, and additionally send automated responses to those customers](https://efficientera.com/pages/seller-feedback/). Our recommendation: funnel the negative seller feedback emails into a ticketing system to be responded to manually, but send automatic responses to positive seller feedback which thank the customer and provide a link to leave a product review.

### 3) Leverage Email Automation

Speaking of automation and Efficient Era, another great use of automation is [follow-up emails, sent after every order](https://efficientera.com/pages/postorder/). What matters, of course, is how you use those follow-up emails, and what you accomplish with them.

With your follow-up emails, you want to be:

1. Giving your customer all the necessary information about your product ahead of time, so that they can have a great experience the moment it arrives,
2. Facilitating positive reviews, and...
3. Letting customers contact you for help before they post a negative review.

Plus, you also need to do all this in a way that isn’t annoying to customers!

To get an idea how to do this, we can look at the example of our sister company, [Plugable Technologies](http://plugable.com/), and how they use Efficient Era’s follow-up emails to the best effect.

Follow-up emails can trigger from many events, but Plugable chooses to only send one email per order, between when the product ships and when it arrives.

Because Plugable sells electronics, we provide instruction manuals and driver downloads in the follow-up email — customers can install these drivers ahead of time, so that when they receive the product, it works right away.

We also include the phrase “if anything is wrong at all, just reply to this email to reach us,” making it very easy for unhappy customers to reach out to us in case of a problem. These replies get sent through our ticketing system, so we can deal with the customer’s problem as a customer service incident and work with it through them personally. As with seller feedback responses, this helps us to avoid negative reviews before they happen.

Finally, we say “your experience with the product is valuable information for other customers, and we’d love to have you share that experience in the form of a review,” with a link to leave a review following it up. Hopefully, if they had a negative experience, they’ve already reached out to us, so these reviews should be mostly positive. Again, it’s all about making it easy — but this time, making it easy to leave a positive review, since Amazon doesn’t do that on its own.

Through all of this, you should have a system that provides necessary information to customers, mitigates negative reviews, and encourages positive reviews, all without being pushy or bothersome.

### 4) Quickly Deal with Negative Reviews (When they Happen)

No amount of alerts or follow-up emails will prevent every negative review. Negative reviews are a fact of life, but you need to be able to deal with them — don’t just sit back and watch them pile up.

Unfortunately, Amazon makes this difficult, because they don’t notify you when you receive a review (positive or negative).

So, you’d want to be able to do two things:

1. Know when reviews come in, especially negative reviews
2. Contact negative reviewers and, yet again, treat that negative review as a customer service incident.

Sometimes, a negative review is really just an opinion — someone who just didn’t like the color, or thought it was too glossy, or anything in between. Most of the time, however, the problem is something your customer service team could fix, or at least help them with. For example, if the item arrived broken, you could send them a replacement. That initial hit in profit will be made up many times over if the replacement results in a removed negative review.

So, with Efficient Era, we sent you an email as soon as a negative review pops up, and you can send that through your ticketing system of choice. [Then, if the order was placed since you joined Efficient Era, **we can match the product review to the order it came from.**](https://efficientera.com/pages/feedback/) Once you have that order number, you can reach out to the customer through Seller Central and help them, potentially turning around the negative review!

Note that, in order for the order matching to work, they have to have a) placed the order since you joined Efficient Era, and b) bought it directly from you (it will not work if you distribute your product and they bought it from another source).

### Conclusion

With a system of mitigating negative reviews and encouraging positive reviews set up, an easy method of dealing with negative reviews when they pop up, and a brand and marketing force working to generate sales and reviews in the first place, you should be all set to solve the cold-start problem!

No matter what, it will be slow-going at first. It’s all about getting over that hump. As long as you can get those first few reviews, the flywheel will start turning, sales and reviews will feed into more sales and more reviews, and you’ll be off to the races.
