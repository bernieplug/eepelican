### Transcript:

Hi, I’m Bernie Thompson, the founder of Efficient Era, and I wanted to show you the top 5 ways that I use the Efficient Era Inventory Health Analysis tools to help make better decisions and analyze my inventory/sales rate for my 8-figure Amazon selling business.

### 1 - Get a Bird’s Eye View of Big Decisions

Number one is: I use [the Inventory Health tool] to get a bird’s eye view of some big decisions that I want to make, or have made. 

![Number 1 Chart](/images/blog/2017/08/part1-chart.png)

Here we have a chart that shows what happened when we opened a warehouse for the first time. Prior to about the middle of this chart, we were using only outsourced logistics providers. Where you see that blue line dropping, that is our inventory at Amazon getting a lot more lean, because we opened up our own warehouse and we were able to ship things in in smaller volume. 

So, I can see clearly now the benefits of opening our warehouse (because I certainly know there’s costs too) and over time, I can monitor how lean we are and make sure the amount of inventory relative to the amount of sales doesn’t get out of whack. By the way, where those two lines cross in the middle, they’re at different scales, so the inventory of the Amazon where they cross is 10 weeks of sales, whereas the orange line is 1 week of sales for each data point. So, it’s really helpful to be able to see this in perspective. 

### 2 - Drill Down on Individual Products

Number two: I use it all the time to drill down on individual products. Check out this example. 

![Number 2 Chart](/images/blog/2017/08/part2-chart.png)

So, this is what we all dream about: here we have a rocket, a hot runner. It’s a product that we  simply can’t keep in stock. What’s challenging about a product like this is, you’ll notice that the blue line (inventory) keeps hitting the bottom, while the orange line (sales) then reacts by shooting up, then dropping back down. The blue line is us going out of stock, and the orange line is the sales wanting to take off, but every time it takes off, we run out of all of our stock. 

When I’m looking at *Amazon’s* data at any particular moment, it’s not giving me the right signal on how much to order. But, when I look at this chart, I can see the overall trend, and I can actually see “oh man, I shouldn’t be looking at just this week’s sales numbers or this month’s sales numbers, I actually have to be extrapolating up from that in order to reorder the right amount.” 

By the end of this chart, after several mistakes or several struggles to try and stay in stock with this one, we actually were able to get caught up, and this has been a great runner for us. I would not have been able to take the risks I needed to take and make the right decisions without seeing this perspective back in time of both stock levels and our sales levels with this product. 

### 3 - Annotate with Timeline Events

The Efficient Era inventory health analysis charts have the ability to annotate them; basically, to add events on a certain date. So, this graph is really interesting. 

![Number 3 Chart](/images/blog/2017/08/part3-chart.png)

You’ll notice on the right-hand side that the orange line (or sales line) has bubbled up. We were kind of flat for a while, and now we’ve taken a jump up. Well, what’s happening here? The annotation tells the story. What happened right at this AQ point is, we were able to get some updates to this product to make it compatible with Macs. Previously, it was a Windows-only product. That caused, pretty much by itself, that sales bubble that you see here on the right. So now we can see the benefit when we’ve got other products in a similar situation, where there may be a way forward to get Mac compatibility. We can see what’s at stake — we can see that we have a significant upside if we can achieve that. 

![Number 3 Events](/images/blog/2017/08/part3-events.png)

We use these inventory health events for all kinds of stuff, where we’re doing A/B tests or we make some sort of change, and then we want to know whether that change made a difference. And unless you can really look at things from a historical perspective, it’s really hard to see that difference. These charts give us the ability to do just that.

### 4 - Purely Looking at the Historical Perspective

Number four is just purely looking at that historical perspective. The chart I have up right now, you can see that the sales (the orange line) is going down. 

![Number 4 Chart](/images/blog/2017/08/part4-chart.png)

This is an interesting story. We had a top-selling product in a category on Amazon, but then AmazonBasics came in, sourced from the same supplier we were sourcing from, and competed directly with us. You can see that the sales dropped to about half or 30% of what they had been previously. This actually happened a few years back, but it’s so nice to be able to go back in time and be able to see that, because we learned things. In fact, just this month, we noticed that in another set of products that have been very successful for us, AmazonBasics has just come in and is competing head-to-head with us on those products. So now we can be on the lookout, and we know what will happen if we’re not able to hold off AmazonBasics — it’ll probably look like this older chart did. So I can make better decisions now, in terms of being conservative with my purchase orders, but also kind of “gird for battle,” and look at our pricing and look at everything we can possibly do to hold off AmazonBasics on those products too. 

### 5 - Stock Alerts

And last, number five, stock alerts! So, in addition to simply having these charts, we have emails go out to you on key events that happen. Every week you get (kind of) a weekly movers email, every day you get products that have hit new max shipment rates. 

![Number 5 Screenshot](/images/blog/2017/08/part5-screenshot.png)

I use those all the time as a trigger to look back at these charts to say “oh, wow, I just hit a new max sales rate on this product, should I be reordering?” I can then get that historical context to make that decision from the charts. But it’s the email, it’s the alerts, that prompts me to look so that I don’t have to look at everything. I only need to look at the things that are really moving, and that saves me time. 

### Conclusion
