##Inspiration from Successful Entrepreneurs

<p class="Class2"> Amazon interviews successful sellers and features them on their channel <a href="https://services.amazon.com/stories.html" target="_blank">Amazon’s Day One: Stories of Entrepreneurship</a>. A few of these stories are listed here. However, there are plenty of other Amazon sellers whose stories deserve to be shared. Here are some inspirational sellers who found success through Amazon FBA:
</p>
###1.	Best Costumes and Toy Deals
<p class="Class2">Michael Ward is the award-winning founder of Best Costumes and Deals. Originally an eBay seller, Michael already had strong e-commerce experience prior to joining the Amazon game. Michael carefully strategized his entrance into the Amazon market, with no outside financing. Joining Amazon in 2011, Best Costumes and Toy Deals gained a profit starting from year one, despite a rough adjustment period to Amazon’s many policies. Two years later, Michael would later find even more success by gradually transitioning to Amazon FBA-<a href="" target="_blank"> and saw his revenue jump from $1.3 million to $2.5 million</a>. Now as an Amazon FBA Seller, Ward is expanding globally to other markets and speaks regularly at entrepreneurial events.

###2.	TechArmor
<p class="Class2">With the motto, “You Play, We Protect”, Tech Armor is the <a href="http://www.cpcstrategy.com/blog/2015/07/q4-amazon-seller-tips/" target="_blank">number #1</a> ranked brand for screen protectors online. Originally a two-person team, Joseph Jaconi and Eric Tong founded their business in 2012 with the goal of providing alternatives to overpriced mobile gear. They did everything, from shipping to customer service. But after six years of being on Amazon, their business has expanded dramatically in terms of sales and staff. Although the duo at first did every aspect of the business by themselves, they eventually switched to FBA.  By joining the FBA program, they realized they were saving a lot of time, which they used to focus on expanding their Amazon private label. Now they’ve expanded their business globally, to the point where their business overseas has outpaced their growth in the United States.

###3.	Solo Eyewear
<p class="Class2">Created with the goal of funding eye care for people who don’t have access to health care, SOLO Eyewear was founded by Jenny Amaraneni and Dana Holliday while studying at San Diego State University. Creating eco-friendly sunglasses, SOLO uses scrap pieces of flooring to repurpose them into a stylish pair of shades. With their business, they focused on donating 10% of their profits to non-profits who provided health services to restore vision. Although they built a strong retail presence online and offline, they saw a large increase in sales after switching to FBA. By joining Amazon, a major benefit the company received was the ability to see valuable feedback from their customers about their products. So far, the company has provided vision restoration treatments to over <a href="http://www.cpcstrategy.com/blog/2016/07/solo-eyewear-impact-fba-amazon-prime-shipping/" target="_blank"> 11,000 people</a>.

After Hurricane Wilma hit in 2005, the business took a serious hit as Barry and Lisa struggled with having no power and re-building their roof. They could have lost all of their inventory, but thankfully due to quick thinking and luck, their business survived. After recovering from the hurricane, Barry and Lisa jumped on the chance to join Amazon FBA, since it would help them protect their inventory in cases of any future disasters. As <a href="https://sellersplaybook.com/entrepreneur-inspiration/" target="_blank">Barry says</a>, “With Amazon, small businesses can find peace of mind regarding these calamities”. Not only did FBA provide them with more security, but it also freed up their time to improve customer service and their inventory.
