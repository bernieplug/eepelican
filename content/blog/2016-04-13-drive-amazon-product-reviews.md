Anytime you buy products online, choose a restaurant or solicit any other service, you read online reviews. Customers trust online reviews as much as personal recommendations. Being an e-commerce seller, reviews will be one of your greatest tickets to success. Having more reviews increases your visibility when products are searched for. While there may be illegitimate ways to generate reviews, those will ultimately be uncovered and hurt your reputation. Fortunately, there are lots of ways of positively encouraging reviews.

Send a post order email thanking your customer for purchasing your product, offering to help if they have any trouble, and providing a link to submit a review if all’s well. Most of this is common courtesy and just plain good customer service. Something this simple has a huge impact on generating a high percentage of reviews. Most of the time, this service can and should be automated for you.

Solicit the top Amazon reviewers. These reviewers have a lot of credibility in the Amazon Marketplace. They have reviewed thousands of items and customers immediately look to these people as experts to see what they have to say. If you search for Amazon’s Top Reviewers, these people are easy to find and often have contact information available. Amazon even has a ‘Hall of Fame’ section for their most elite reviewers.  

In additon to reviewers, seek out bloggers. Find ones who focus on your product niche. Which blogs do you read when doing product research for your own company? Develop relationships with these people and offer them products to review. This is basically a two for one. You get a review and perhaps some free PR on their blog because they have developed a relationship with you and now they also love your product and want to tell the world about it.

Remember to follow the three top rules for solicited reviews:  

1. No reviews from friends, family, or business partners, or coworkers

2. No payment to a reviewer, other than the free or discounted product itself

3. You must be clear with the reviewer that you welcome positive or negative feedback, and their product review must disclose that a free or discounted product was given in exchange for a fair and honest review.

Lastly, don’t forget to say thank you for the review. Saying thank you can lead to a multitude of positive results. This person will become a repeat client and in addition to a good review, their word of mouth recommendation will also be huge.
