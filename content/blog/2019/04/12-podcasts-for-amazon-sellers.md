Podcasts are booming right now and are a valuable source of entertainment. But they’re
also a perfect learning tool, especially for the person without enough time. For the busy
Amazon seller, there are many podcasts that could be a learning resource to you.

them!

### The Amazing Seller
A “die-hard podcast listener”, Scott Voelker is an Amazon Seller that couldn’t find any
podcasts that focused on FBA private label success. Eventually, Voelker decided he
would create the FBA show he wanted to listen to. After starting The Amazing Seller in
2014, he started interviewing successful sellers and providing tips to Amazon sellers.
Our founder, Bernie Thompson, was a guest on this podcast last year. To hear about

advanced selling strategies related to FBA products. With a different focus on each
