Although Amazon has taken steps to crack down on counterfeit products this year, counterfeit products are still a huge issue that’s affecting both private labels and their customers. While Amazon continues to work on improving their seller protection policies, there are steps you can take to protect your private label products. 

### Build A Strong Brand

When you’re creating your private label products, you need to make sure your branding is strong. Have strong branding on your products and their packaging, so counterfeits are easy to spot. Build your own brand website- not just because it provides a sales channel that listing hijackers can’t penetrate, but also because diversifying your sales strategy is a good business tactic overall. 

Consider legal protection for your brand. Trademark your brand name, so you have some legal protection over your products. Register your brand with the [Amazon Brand Registry](https://brandservices.amazon.com/), to make sure that Amazon officially recognizes your brand. It won’t prevent other sellers from selling your actual product, but it will make it easier for you to get rid of obvious counterfeit products being sold on your listing. 


### Monitor Constantly

To protect your product listings, you need to monitor your store consistently. Keep an eye out for any sudden dips in sales. Double-check your listings on a regular basis to make sure no other seller has mysteriously appeared on them. As a private label seller, you need to be vigilant. 

Unfortunately, not every seller has the luxury of monitoring every listing, especially with a large product catalog. Thankfully, Efficient Era provides both [Buy Box and Listing Hijack alerts](https://efficientera.com/), which will notify you whenever you lose the buy box or have unplanned changes to your product listing. 


### Complain to the Seller

If you see a counterfeiter on your product listing, you need to take action. Contact them via the “Ask a Question” button on the seller’s profile. Send them a message that you’ll report them for selling fake products. You can even send them a cease & desist letter. If they refuse to comply, then you can escalate the issue to Amazon. 

### Complain to Amazon

If you see any infringements against your private label, you have to be proactive with the Amazon team. Report any violations that you see and don’t be afraid to follow-up with the Amazon staff to make sure the issue is resolved. Make sure you document everything regarding your product listing and your interactions with the counterfeit seller- it builds a stronger case that you can bring to the Amazon team. 

With these steps, you will be able to protect your product listing from potential counterfeiters. Being a proactive seller is key to make sure that you and your customers aren’t being ripped off. Unfortunately, while Amazon struggles with improving their seller protection policies and preventing counterfeits, it’s up to the seller to take these preventative steps.
