Writing the perfect review request is tricky. You have to comply with all of Amazon’s [policies]((https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/external/200383320?language=en-US&amp;ref=mpbc_200441890_cont_200383320))
regarding Buyer-Seller Messaging, while still trying to convince the customer to leave a review.
It’s easy to misstep- which is why we outline what not to do below. We even include a few
examples! Hopefully, by seeing some examples of post-order emails gone wrong, you’ll know
what to avoid in the future.

## Asking for Only a Positive Review
#### What NOT to do:
*After you’ve had time with your purchase, you can leave a review here. Please contact us at
support@boutiqueclothingbrands.com if you have any questions about your order.*

#### What to do:
*After you’ve had time with your purchase, you can leave a review here. Please contact us at
support@boutiqueclothingbrands.com if you have any questions about your order.*

Although this review request may not set off any alarm bells at first, this review technically does
violate Amazon’s Terms of Service. Amazon’s review policies require all review requests to be
strictly neutral- this request implies that only happy customers should leave a review. Negative
customers are instructed to only contact customer service. To truly follow Amazon’s policies,
your review request should only be asking for a review, not necessarily just a positive one.

## Linking to an External Website
#### What NOT to do:
*To find more of our products, visit petstorewares.com.*

This is a direct violation of Amazon policy, which prohibits links to sites outside of Amazon.com.
Amazon doesn’t want you diverting potential sales from their website, so review requests
including external links can get you in trouble. It’s best just to avoid this tactic altogether.

## Over-Sending Emails
Amazon’s policies on how many review request can be sent out are a bit hazy- but we generally
recommend only sending out review requests once or twice to customers. Anything more and
the seller risks being reported for spam.

## Not Obeying Opt-Outs
For years now, Amazon has allowed customers to opt-out of receiving messages from sellers.
Customers can do this by clicking the unsubscribe button on any Amazon email. However,
using Efficient Era- you can also manually unsubscribe a customer from your emails. You can
do this by going to your [Email Settings](https://app.efficientera.com/emails/settings) 
and adding the unsubscribed email to your customer blacklist.

It should be noted that some sellers include the [Important] tag in the subject line of their emails
to get their message through to unsubscribed customers. Although this practice is allowed by
Amazon, it should only be used for cases when the seller needs to send vital product
information to a customer (like when the product needs an instruction manual). Otherwise,
sellers who abuse the important tag to spam their customers can be penalized.

## Using Trademarks Without Permission

Although this may seem like an obvious misstep, there are sellers who use other company’s
logos or trademarks without permission to make their emails look more legitimate (this is
especially in the case of counterfeiters). We’ve even heard of sellers trying to use the Amazon
logo to trick customers into thinking they’re buying directly from Amazon. No, no, no. Don’t do
this! It’s a fast way to get banned from selling on Amazon.

## Over Communicating
#### What NOT to do:
*With the rising cost of being a seller on Amazon, you’d be surprised how much a review
matters. All of our products are handcrafted in Italy, which is really expensive. Then we have to
ship them to you. You’ll be surprised how difficult it can be, Amazon takes a cut of our profit
every time! That’s why we need a review from you to boost our sales.*

#### What to do:
*We’d appreciate it if you left a review of your purchase. You can do so here.*

Writing a short-to-the-point message is the best way to send a review request. Otherwise, you
risk losing your customer’s attention. This is not the time to air your personal grievances
(especially against Amazon) or even the time to over-share about how you craft your product.
You’d be surprised how many sellers do this! Just keep the message simple and to the point.

## Adding a Marketing or Promotional Message
#### What NOT to do:
*Like our product? Use the code TWENTY to receive twenty percent off your next product from
our website!*

Although it’s tempting to incentivize customers to place repeat orders from your store, including
any marketing or promotions within your email is strictly prohibited by Amazon. Again, the
Amazon team wants to make sure that you’re not diverting sales from the Amazon platform in
any way. Avoid the temptation and refrain from offering any promotions.

## Adding Oversized Files
Depending on your product, you may want to send an instructional manual or some other file to
customers after they receive their order. However, Amazon only allows up to 10 MB of files
attached to a message. If you exceed this limit, your emails may not send out to customers.
Make sure to stay below this limit to ensure all of your emails actually send out.

## Staying Too Generic

Even though writing your own review requests are tricky, customization is still key in actually
receiving a review for your store. Make sure to describe your product accurately, so reviewers
know how to use your product. Let them know a little bit about your store’s history! Breaking
away from a plain generic template is key to gaining new reviews. Just make sure that your
email isn’t too long.

Hopefully, these tips will help you when crafting your perfect post-order emails. Efficient Era’s
[email features](https://app.efficientera.com/emails/templates/) can make asking for a review easy.
