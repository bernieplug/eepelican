Summary: Efficient Era Shutting Down July 4th

Thank you for the enthusiasm you have shown for Efficient Era! The Amazon tools space is 
crowded and fast-changing. Amazon has become very active in imposing limitations and 
requirements on tools in order to retain MWS access or be in the app store. These 
requirements demand quick software development and larger teams to keep the tool running. 
We were not able to make this work financially for us.

Unfortunately, we will be closing Efficient Era on July 4th. Until then, you have time to 
download your data off of Efficient Era and switch to another platform. We have turned off 
all charges for the tool in this final month - you will have no more payments, making some 
portion of this last month free for you.

We want to thank you for being an Efficient Era customer. We hope that you enjoyed using 
Efficient Era as much as we enjoyed working with you.
