Summary: As some of you know, Efficient Era is officially now on Amazon’s Marketplace Appstore!

The Marketplace Appstore is a one-stop-shop where the small and medium-sized businesses that sell on
Amazon can more easily discover quality applications to help them automate, manage and grow their
business. Accessible from Seller Central, the Marketplace Appstore features applications created by
Amazon and external developers and covers a range of functionalities across the selling lifecycle.

Recently, the Marketplace Appstore introduced a rating and review system to the store. We’d love to

an Efficient Era customer.
