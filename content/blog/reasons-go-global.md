Summary: Expanding to global markets on Amazon is often overlooked, but it's a great way to grow your business. Here's a few reasons why you should give it a try.
Status: draft

Let’s say you’ve already got a pretty successful local, [private-label](https://efficientera.com/blog/2015/08/5-reasons-you-should-be-a-private-label.html) Amazon business. You probably have a fair number of solid products with a good number of positives reviews on each, with decent search ranking and monthly sales. However, what if you’re looking to grow your business? One way would be to offer more products, but that can be difficult for a number of reasons. The US Amazon market is heavily populated, and many categories simply have no room left for competition. You might barely have a foothold in your own category as it stands - adding new products in that category would be pointless and trying to expand into new categories even more so. What options do you have left for growth?

An extremely powerful growth option that many local Amazon merchants don’t consider at first is expanding into global markets. It makes sense to think locally when you’re first starting out your Amazon business - just getting your foot in the door of one market is enough work. You may have also thought about it once you had achieved a more comfortable standing in the marketplace, but thought it too daunting a task. 

Thankfully, going global is much easier than it appears at first glance, especially on Amazon. If you’re looking for an interesting and high-potential way to grow your business, you should definitely give global diversification a look. Here’s why.

### 1. FBA Makes Shipping Effortless

If you’re a private label seller on Amazon, you almost definitely know about FBA, and you most likely use it too. As useful as FBA is locally, it’s even better for international sales. Before FBA, the number one reason for the difficulty of international expansion was the cost of international shipping. Now, thanks to FBA, you only have to ship your inventory to one fulfillment center per market and Amazon handles the rest. If you’re outsourcing your manufacturing anyway, it’s a very similar process to local sales. 

A specific benefit of selling in the EU markets - the UK, Germany, France, Spain, and Italy - is that you only need to ship to *one* fulfillment center in any of these markets, and that fulfillment center will ship inventory to the other four markets! All you have to do is relist your items in each of the other markets you want to sell in, and the fulfillment center in the first country will fulfill orders in all other EU markets.

### 2. International Markets are Small, but Fast-Growing

As you undoubtedly know, the US Amazon market is cutthroat and difficult to get started in. If that’s where you started your career as an Amazon merchant, you’ve had to overcome some major challenges. This is mostly because it’s so large, and there are bound to be people who had the same ideas or products as you, only earlier. 

Fortunately, many of the international markets are significantly smaller than the US. In 2015, 56% of Amazon’s net revenue came from North America (including Canada), and the remaining 44% was split between *all* other international markets, including the UK, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and Japan. However, the markets are growing quickly - Amazon’s international net revenue doubled between 2012 and 2015.

The smaller size means it’s significantly easier to get started in these markets, as there’s simply less competition. Additionally, the fast growth means that these geographies have the potential to become more and more profitable once you get your footing. Don’t get too comfortable, however - these markets have been growing for a while now, so the competition isn’t nonexistent any more.

Nevertheless, a great example of the accessibility of international Amazon markets is the review count needed to make a splash. We’ve found that in order to start making sales in Amazon US, your products need to have anywhere from 30-100 reviews. In contrast, you’ll start seeing sales in international markets with as few as 5-10 reviews on your products. 

### 3. Efficient Era Offers Tools to Help!

For the most part, selling internationally on Amazon is very similar to private-label FBA selling in the United States. You’ll still have to contact suppliers, create high-quality listings, ship to fulfillment centers, and everything else. However, the devil is in the details, and there are a few little things that can trip you up in your path to global expansion.

One of these important details is the need to send VAT invoices. These are a necessity for a number of European purchases, and sending them manually costs dozens of man-hours as they begin to add up. 

Fortunately, Efficient Era has tools to help! [You can read more about our VAT tool here](https://efficientera.com/blog/2016/03/automating-your-vat-invoices-for-amazon-eu.html), but we also offer many other tools to help international Amazon sellers.
