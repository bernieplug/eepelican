Every Amazon seller can benefit from a virtual assistant in one form or another. Having so many tasks can keep your focus distracted and cause a stunt in the growth of your business. Since this is something you don’t want, it’s important to know there are professionals out there who can help you get the desired results while you are focusing on responsibilities which need your attention.

If you are one of these Amazon sellers who cannot find enough time in the day to stay productive and keep your business moving forward, here are ten different options you have within the virtual assistant community which will benefit your company with their talents.

### 1 - Customer Service

As a business owner who wants growth within your business, one of the highest priorities your brand should have internally is a customer service worker who can devote their time to helping your past, present, and future customers. 

This can be a full time job for most, especially if you see continued growth in your Amazon store. Knowing this, having a virtual assistant who can help you with this foundational task is a necessary hire for anyone’s business.

An expert customer service representative is just that; an extension of your brand itself. They stand in proxy for you and act as a go-between and a problem solver to the outside world. This person will be well-versed in people skills and should know your business and its products inside and out to be most effective.

*(Editor’s Note: If you’re using Efficient Era with Buyer-Review Matching, customer service also includes emailing negative reviewers and addressing their concerns — a task perfectly suited for virtual assistants. -Bruce)*

### 2 - Fulfilling Orders

One of the biggest time sucking responsibilities is getting all of your customer orders sent to your patrons. 

These virtual assistants can help you with order entry, shipping, and invoicing to your customers on a continual basis. You can allow them to compile the orders, send the drop-ship invoices to your vendors (if required), and take care of all refunds, exchanges, and processing.

### 3 - Managing Tracking Information

For every one of your products you will need to include [tracking information](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=200365270) which can be managed, sent, and followed for every customer. These virtual assistants will be able to provide the tracking number and set up a carrier with your new packages. 

If your Amazon business moves a lot of products daily, having someone to help manage and set up tracking can be a full time job. Hiring someone to do this for you can free up your time to focus on other responsibilities.

### 4 - Listing New Products

Let’s face it, for each individual product you set up, a lot of time is required to ensure the success of the particular product in question. 

From the ASIN number to picking out the best image to represent what you are trying to sell, this can also take up a lot of your time. Again, if you’re moving a lot of products, having someone in your corner to load these up for you can help you see more productive growth for your business.

### 5 - Updating Inventory on Current Products

Do you find your products changing? Maybe you want to add or take away certain descriptive elements or edit specific products such as color, size, etc. Keeping your inventory updated on your Amazon store is necessary to ensure your customers are getting exactly what you’re selling online.

### 6 - Optimizing Product Content for Amazon SEO

If you want to be seen at the top of the listings for your particular niche in Amazon, then you must understand how to [optimize your content listing](https://www.highervisibility.com/blog/how-to-optimize-your-amazon-product-listings-2015-edition/). 

There are professionals you can hire who can complete this for you effectively daily. More than likely, they have done this more than once and they know what is required to create the perfect optimization for your product.

Things like headlines, the body of the content listing, and calls to action inside the text description can mean the difference between a customer purchasing or not. It all hinges on the search. Actually, this task should be the most time you spend on each individual product because it determines whether or not the searcher will find you. 

If you have a dream of setting up a successful Amazon store, or if you’re already a seasoned professional, acquiring someone who has this expertise in their wheelhouse can always push your business forward on the Amazon platform.

### 7 - Running PPC Ads on Amazon

Millions of potential customers are searching the Amazon webstore every month, and, whether they know it or not, these people are searching with long-tailed keywords to find the product of choice.

Creating a [PPC campaign on Amazon](https://freeeup.com/better-freelancer-leverage-amazon-facebook-ppc/) requires you to take the best of these keywords and pay Amazon to push your business to the front based on the keyword.

For this job, you need someone who is experienced in sponsored ads, keyword research, analytics and data split tests to discover which keywords are working the best and which are not.

### 8 - Managing Amazon Seller Metrics

Your [Amazon seller metrics](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html/?nodeId=12880481) are the backbone of your business. Each successful Amazon store owner makes sure to always monitor performance, logistics, and sales metrics based on their personal store.

Performance metrics are tied to customer service, feedback and ratings and are linked to a lot of customer-based reactions. Logistics share which products are moving faster than others so you can prepare, restock, and adjust accordingly to what your store is doing. Sales metrics helps you monitor and manage the growth of your store which helps you make future decisions like hiring, expanding, etc. Try Amazon’s [Inventory Planning Dashboard](https://trustfile.avalara.com/blog/drive-higher-fba-sales-with-the-inventory-planning-dashboard/) to get the best results.

For this job to be done well, you need a VA who has been in the trenches where they have been tried and tested with a track record of success. This is your baby, and when entrusting it with intimate analytics like this, you need to make sure you research work history and even talk with past clients to get your hiring answers.

### 9 - Managing Customer Feedback Rating

[Feedback](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=200278890) is the lifeblood of your Amazon store and can determine the result of potential customers getting ready to purchase. 

Having someone to manage the feedback rating and reviewing current feedback daily with detailed reports of how your store is doing is a great way to stay on track to please your customers. 

Whether it’s resolving feedback, contacting a buyer after incorrect feedback is given, removing buyer feedback, or simply responding to feedback already published, a virtual assistant can help you keep the ball rolling in this department and can increase productivity and growth in your community.

### 10 - Graphic Design for Powerful Imagery

Have you ever heard the old saying, “A picture is worth a thousand words”? It’s true. The image is something which can grasp your potential buyer and create interest to trigger the buying process. 

While you spend as much time as you can on optimizing your listing, it does no good at all if the customer lands on your product and doesn’t have a visual image to base their determinations on.

Knowing this, graphic design is an art form. A virtual assistant whose expertise is in this area can really boost your buyer experience and your overall sales.

### In Conclusion

If your business is starting to see some increases in sales and you’re finding it hard to keep up with all of the responsibilities to keep it running effectively, then it’s time to reach out to an expert to help you continue this rate of growth.

All in all, this is your business and in order to continue on the path to success, you need someone who has a targeted expertise you can use to the benefit of your business.
