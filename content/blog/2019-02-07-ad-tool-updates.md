You may notice a new look to the Ad Tool. We've recently updated 2 important parts of our Ad Tool: the **Dashboard** and **Product Performance** pages.

With the new Dashboard, you'll see the exact numbers on important metrics such as Bid Adjustments, New Keywords, Match Type Changes, and more.  You'll also see an expanded view of your campaign performance graphs.

In the new Product Performance section, you'll be able to see summaries of your products with the Lowest Impressions, Lowest CTR, Lowest Converting, and Highest ACoS. You'll also be able to adjust the Target ACoS for a specific product here.
