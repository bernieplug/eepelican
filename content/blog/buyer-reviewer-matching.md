We all know [how important reviews are](https://efficientera.com/blog/2015/08/start-paying-attention-to-your-amazon-reviews.html). They can make or break your Amazon career, especially as a [private label seller](https://efficientera.com/blog/2015/08/5-reasons-you-should-be-a-private-label.html). One too many negative reviews can send a product to the dustbin of low sales and search ranking, while enough positive reviews can drive your rank and your sales to the very top of your category. 
	
Knowing this, it can be frustrating when a customer leaves a negative review that describes a problem you can easily fix. Maybe something went wrong with the shipping, or they received a product with an uncommon defect that isn’t representative of your product as a whole. Even more frustrating is the fact that Amazon reviewers often post reviews under an alias, so it can be difficult to find and contact the buyer associated with that review. 

Efficient Era believes that contacting reviewers to [address negative reviews](https://efficientera.com/blog/2015/08/3-steps-to-changing-a-negative-amazon-review.html) is a hugely important part of running a successful Amazon business, and so we have developed extremely reliable buyer-reviewer software to help remedy this problem. Other companies have tried to offer solutions to this problem, but their methods are often unreliable and connect to the wrong buyer or not at all. Efficient Era’s software is much more consistent, allowing you to find the buyer associated with the review every time and reach out to address the problem.

This feature couldn’t be easier to use. First, locate the review you’d like to match with a buyer. You can do this through the Product Review Dashboard, the Reviews by Product, or the All Reviews sections. Once you’ve found the review you want, click on the “Related Orders” drop-down on the right of the review text. This drop-down will show you all of the orders associated with this review, and you can directly contact the buyer from here.

Buyer-reviewer matching is an extremely powerful tool, but some caution is advised. Amazon lets reviewers choose an alias for a reason: they strongly dislike review solicitation or manipulation. They believe that reviews should be an unbiased source of review for products, and so they make it difficult for sellers to directly contact reviewers and ask for positive reviews, for example. 

If you are an Amazon seller, you’re undoubtedly familiar with Amazon’s terms of use. However, just to reiterate, you are forbidden from asking for only positive reviews, offering compensation for a review (other than a free/discounted product), or asking reviewers to remove a negative review. Additionally, if you do offer a free or discounted product, you must deliver it ahead of the review being written, and it must be made clear that you are soliciting an unbiased review. 
	
Despite this, asking what went wrong with a negative review or thanking a customer for a positive review (without asking for extra favors), are perfectly allowed and even recommended. You should absolutely take advantage of our software to reach out to reviewers, but be careful in doing so and don’t overstep your boundaries.
