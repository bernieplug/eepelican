Writing is hard enough. Selling your books on Amazon should be the easy part. Efficient Era has developed a set of tools to make selling simpler.

Efficient Era has many services, so which ones are right for you? Well, to start, the [review notification tool](https://efficientera.com/pages/feedback/review-notifications.html). This feature will alert you any time someone leaves a review for your product. No more checking your listings every day in the hopes of a positive review. Instead, you’ll get an email automatically to let you know.

Interested? Here’s a few tips to help you get started.

After you make an account, the first thing you’ll want to do is enter your MWS details under the credentials tab of account settings. This will allow us to show you which buyer left the review. [Check out our post about MWS credentials](https://efficientera.com/blog/2015/08/registering-your-amazon-account-with-mws.html) to make sure they are set up correctly.

The next thing on your to-do list is entering your products. There are two ways to do this. If you want to do it manually, click products and follow the instructions. Just remember that for books, the ASIN is the 10 digit ISBN. If you’d rather leave it to us, select “Generate products from Amazon orders” and the software will input your products automatically. This option can be found under account settings.

Step three is enabling Product Review Notifications under the Feedback Features. Once you’ve done this, you can customize the tool for your needs. I’ll walk you through the fields one by one.

### Review notification email

This is the email address that all reviews will be sent to - the good and the bad. If you’re only interested in addressing negative reviews, leave this field blank. 

### Negative review notification email

The email provided in this field will receive any reviews below the minimum star threshold. It can be the same as the main email, it can be left blank if you want all reviews, or it can be another address entirely. One tip we have for sellers is to use a customer service software for ticketing in conjunction with this tool. If you choose to do so, then you’ll want to send the negative reviews to a unique email dedicated to addressing customer problems.

### Minimum stars

What do you consider a negative review: anything below five stars, or just the one star reviews? It’s different for each seller based on what they are selling. That’s why we let you decide what your threshold is. 

### Tracked products

Here you’ll be able to select which products to monitor. If you’re like us, this means all of the products!

### Keep track of reviewer

If you provide your MWS credentials, this feature will show which buyer posted the review. Otherwise, you’ll just see the reviews, not who posted them. When this feature is enabled, you just check off which Amazon marketplaces you wish to use it in.

All you have to do is hit submit and you’re done!

While you’re at it, feel free to check out the other services we offer. During your free trial period, you can play around and see what else can help your business.
