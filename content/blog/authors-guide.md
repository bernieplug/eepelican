Writing is hard enough. Selling your books on Amazon should be the easy part. Efficient Era has developed a set of tools to make selling simpler.

Efficient Era has many services, so which ones are right for you? Well, to start, the [review notification tool](https://efficientera.com/pages/feedback/review-notifications.html). This feature will alert you any time someone leaves a review for your product. No more checking your listings every day in the hopes of a positive review. Instead, you’ll get an email automatically to let you know.

Interested? Here’s a few tips to help you get started.

After you make an account, the first thing you’ll want to do is enter your products. There are two ways to do this. 

* If you want to do it manually, click "Products" and follow the instructions. Just remember that for books, the Amazon SKU and the ASIN are both the 10 digit ISBN.
* If you’d rather leave it to us, select “Generate products from Amazon orders” and the software will input your products automatically. This option can be found under account settings.

**Optional Step:** Entering your MWS and Seller Central details under the "Credentials" tab of the Account Settings page. *You only need to do this if you're managing your own Amazon listings.* If you are, this will allow us to show you which buyer left the review. Otherwise, you'll still get the reviews, so don't worry. [Check out our post about MWS credentials](https://efficientera.com/blog/2015/08/registering-your-amazon-account-with-mws.html) to make sure they are set up correctly.

The last thing on your to-do list is to enable the "Product Review Notifications" service under the "Feedback" tab in Services & Settings. Once you’ve done this, you can customize the tool for your needs. I’ll walk you through the fields one by one.

### Review notification email

This is the email address that all reviews will be sent to - the good and the bad. If you’re only interested in addressing negative reviews, leave this field blank. 

### Negative review notification email

The email provided in this field will receive any reviews below the minimum star threshold. It can be the same as the main email, it can be left blank if you want all reviews, or it can be another address entirely. One tip we have for sellers is to use a customer service software for ticketing in conjunction with this tool. If you choose to do so, then you’ll want to send the negative reviews to a unique email dedicated to addressing customer problems.

### Minimum stars

What do you consider a negative review: anything below five stars, or just the one star reviews? It’s different for each seller based on what they are selling. That’s why we let you decide what your threshold is. 

### Tracked products

Here you’ll be able to select which products to monitor. If you’re like us, this means all of the products!

### Keep track of reviewer - Optional

If you provided your MWS and Seller Central credentials (see above), this feature will show which buyer posted the review. Otherwise, you’ll just see the reviews, not who posted them. When this feature is enabled, you just check off which Amazon marketplaces you wish to use it in.

### Conclusion

Once you've completed these steps, all you have to do is hit submit and you’re done!

**Note:** It will take up to a day for your reviews to start coming in. Don't be alarmed if you aren't getting emails immediately!
