Summary: Charting is important, but you don't just want data for data's sake. Your data should be easy to read, and it should be actionable. We made Efficient Era sales charting to fit that bill!
Status: draft

Everyone knows that you should chart your sales data — it’s a basic instinct that comes with selling. But, at the end of the day, what does that data actually tell you? Sure, it tells you when your sales peak and when they fall, but can you really take action based on that knowledge?

Let’s say that your sales were up two weeks ago, and you were feeling pretty good. You download a report this week, and notice that sales are down a bit. Why? Does it have anything to do with that decline you saw a month ago? Can you fix it in the same way, or is it something else entirely? Do you really want to wade through pages of Amazon reports to find the problem time and product? There’s no good way to know.

We were having the same problem with our data. All we wanted were charts and reports that we could actually gain some real insight from — we wanted actionable data that’s also easy to process. How did we get that?

Without further ado: the new Efficient Era Sales & Reports feature!

### Quick, Digestible Data

We’ve all tried to slog through Amazon Business data at one point or another. Once our head pops out of the muck, we’re only a little wiser to the ups and downs of our business. 

There is a lot of data in there, but more data isn’t always better — it can easily get overwhelming, and with that much to process at once, you can end up skimming over it instead of spotting the valuable data points you need.  

Sometimes, all you need is a quick look at your data, so that you can get an easy big-picture view without having to wade through individual reports — and that’s exactly what Efficient Era provides.

On the main *Sales and Reports* dashboard, you can see all your sales data in one place, filtered as you please. View your data in aggregate, or choose a product and marketplace to get the nitty-gritty details. No more downloading individual Amazon Business reports — it’s all here.

Of course, just having nice-looking, centralized data doesn’t make it actionable. That’s why we’ve taken your data further with Efficient Era, thanks to events. 

### Powerful Events

There’s one big thing you need to make data actionable: **context.**


You need to be able to tie specific events to spikes or drops in sales. With this context, you can identify what events are causing what shifts, and take informed action from there.


Efficient Era’s sales charts use *events,* which track specific dates along your sales charts and help you pin down exactly what changes caused what effects.

Holiday sale coming up? Mark down an event so you can study not only the initial spike, but any follow-up effects. Competitor overtake you on an important keyword? Mark the date to understand any subsequent losses, in addition to tracking the success of your recovery effort. Events work on both a global scale and a product-specific basis, so you can go from general to precise with ease. 

Efficient Era will even help you out a bit with these events. We’ll automatically detect name changes and price changes, and mark them on your sales charts so that you can track their effects without having to lift a finger.
