###6 - <a href="http://bit.ly/2BAP0ko" target="_blank" style="color:Darkorange"> Right-Railed Sponsored Ads Discontinue</a>
Although Sponsored Ads continue to exist, Amazon eliminated right-railed sponsored ads. By eliminating right-railed sponsored ads, Amazon is hoping to make a smoother shopping experience, where sponsored products can blend in with regular listings.

###9 - <a href="http://bit.ly/2BCQril" target="_blank" style="color:Darkorange">"Discounted by Amazon" Tags Are Launched</a>
Amazon is now offering a "Discounted by Amazon" tag on select products. This tag denotes that Amazon has reduced the price of the item beyond the what the seller originally intended, guaranteeing the lowest price. Amazon will then reimburse the third-party seller for any lost revenue. Digital Trend's article provides a great introduction to this new feature, for both sellers and consumers.

###10 - <a href="http://bit.ly/2BzNWNI"  target="_blank" style="color:Darkorange"> Amazon Introduces a New Refund Policy</a>
