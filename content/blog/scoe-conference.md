Starting your online business from the ground up is sure to be time- and energy-consuming. If not for group collaboration and help from industry experts, most online sellers would struggle to find the path to success. As online retailing has become a major trend in the past few years, the need for new ideas has led online sellers to come together at national ecommerce conferences in hopes of snagging an idea or two. 

If your business is stuck in a rut or you’re looking for new ideas to expand your company, take a break and plan to attend an ecommerce conference sometime this summer. You're sure to catch some solid advice when you're surrounded by thousands of sellers dealing with the same problems as you.

### Experience

For all sellers, new and veteran alike, the SCOE conference will connect you with like-minded sellers from across the globe to swap ideas, trade helpful tips, and discuss the future of the ecommerce industry.

For years, the SCOE conference was referred to as the “Amazon Merchants Conference” due to the ecommerce giant taking over much of the online retailing market. As of 2009, the conference has broadened its horizons and incorporated content for all ecommerce sellers including eBay, Newegg, Etsy and more. 

The SCOE conference will be littered with industry experts. Anything and everything from omnichannel selling to keyword analytics will be discussed in length at the next conference. 

Bernie Thompson, founder of Efficient Era, will be speaking on diversifying and expanding your business by going international. 

### Conclusion

Whether you’re an online retail rookie or you’ve been selling your whole life, the SCOE conference is the place to be. New ideas and the future of ecommerce will be discussed at length by merchants just like you.
