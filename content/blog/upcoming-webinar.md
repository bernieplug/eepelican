### What Will Be Covered?

In this 60-minute webinar, Bernie will talk about 4 winning strategies that have helped him deal with the cold-start problem, stay compliant with Amazon's Terms of Service and grow into a multi-million dollar global business selling products in over 150 countries, primarily using Fulfilment by Amazon. 

He shows you how all this is possible *without gaming the system* or using “tricks” that could ultimately lead to a suspension. He will also be giving a demo of the Efficient Era tools that he uses on a daily basis to achieve all of this. 

### Who is it For?

If you have been selling on Amazon for a while now and would like to take your business to the next level, then this webinar is for you! This webinar will be especially useful if you are a private label seller selling via FBA. On the other hand, the webinar will be specifically geared towards private-label FBA, so you may not get as much out of it if you are a reseller or engaged in retail arbitrage.
