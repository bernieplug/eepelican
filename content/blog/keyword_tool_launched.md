Summary: How do you stack up to your competition when it comes to search rank on Amazon? Start tracking your keywords today and find out!
Status: draft

Every online seller has their own lists of keywords for each of their products. They might have crafted them over time by doing some research, relying on their intuition and looking at similar products. 

Most sellers have also had the experience of typing some of these carefully chosen keywords into the search bar and pressing enter. They scroll down the first page in search of their product. Not there. Onto the second page, and then the third. Finally, they find it, near the top on the fourth page of the results. Not the best place to be.

Sound familiar? That's because keywords are hard. 

Choosing keywords is one thing, but finding out if they work is another. So, what are your options to determine the effectiveness of keyword-related changes to your listing? Go online every day, manually search all your keywords, record your position for each one, monitor if the change increased or decreased accordingly, take action. 

Yeah we didn't like the sound of that either. Here's a keyword you'll be excited to hear: automation.
