Summary: With all of the intense competition in marketing, your social media campaigns need to look as professional as possible. If you're not the most artistically inclined individual we have ideas for you.

If you are selling on Amazon, you realize the importance of trying to drive traffic to your e-commerce store, as well as, to your Amazon listing. In a <a href="https://efficientera.com/blog/2017/10/why-you-should-use-social-media-for-your-amazon-business.html", target=_blank>previous article</a>, we mentioned that advertising on social media could help to build your email list, monetize your brand, build your business for the long term, allow you to promote to existing fan bases, and educate your audience. Most importantly, it can help boost your conversion rates.

With all of the intense competition in marketing, your social media campaign advertising has to look as professional as possible. If you are not the most artistically inclined individual, creating graphics for your social media campaigns may sound extremely scary. You want it to look professional without having to spend a lot on a graphic designer. Luckily, there are websites available that will take your text and turn it into a work of art, without having to hire a super expensive graphic designer either.

We compiled some of the best, most user-friendly graphic generating websites to ease the frustration when it comes to social media advertising.

###Canva

Canva makes it as easy as drag and drop. With tons of premade templates to inspire you, all you need to do is format your text, drag it into position and go from there. Using their tutorials to get started, Canva will walk you through their different tools, fonts, colors, backgrounds, layouts a tons more. They even allow you to upload your own logo and images for a more personalized touch. Canva is the way to go if you are less experienced with design but want a specific look.

###Pablo

Pablo is a great site for making and customizing your own memes and allows you to personalize layouts specifically for Facebook, Pinterest, Instagram, and Twitter. They also make it extremely easy for you to share your custom creations now or schedule them for a later date. This particular content creation system also provides you with thousands of royalty-free images as well as allowing you to upload whatever images you prefer. Pablo will offer you plenty of ways to engage your audience.

###BeFunky

If you find yourself more on the do-it-yourself side of things but PhotoShop is way too advanced and Canva seems too basic, you’ll love BeFunky. It can be a photo editor, collage maker or just help you with a basic design. It is excellent for people who have some amount of design experience and like more control over the outcome of the graphic. If that is you, you’ll want to make sure you cash in on the premium version to have access to all the bells and whistles.

###Recite

Opposite of BeFunky, is Recite. This is a complete plug and play app where you can create memes, quotes or text-based images. In a nutshell, you enter the text you want to display, choose your background, the website generates your image, and you can post to your social media site within minutes. The only drawback is you are not allowed to enter any of your own images or logos. You are sacrificing your logo for theirs, but it is worth it if you need something done in a hurry.

###PiktoChart

This app is fantastic for making your own infographics, which can be time-consuming to make and very frustrating. Similar to Canva, Piktochart offers over 600 infographic templates that will best suit your information. This system also lets you drag and drop different fonts, images, and text boxes to make your data more appealing and easily digested, all the while making it quick and easy for you to create and post.

PicMonkey

PicMonkey is another full control photo editor. If you want more access to the outcome of your art, then this platform is very similar to BeFunky, in that way. They offer textures, borders, and typefaces, but if you want the whole enchilada of editing, you’ll want to make sure you upgrade to the premium. They also offer shortcuts for facebook covers and tutorials to get started.

###Conclusion

Most of these platforms have a free trial or are completely free for their basic editing package. Whether it’s just to add text to a graphic, or create a Facebook Ad from scratch, you are going to find something that will best meet your social media graphic needs. Take your time to look around at each platform and get a sense of which will work best for you. You will be exceedingly happy with the results!
