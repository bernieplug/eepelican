Contacting your customers after their purchase is a great way to make sure they have
everything they may need and to gain some feedback before receiving your product. Amazon
has a few rules for this but as long as you are not peddling any other products or hounding them
with marketing, they will allow it. Here are a few examples of information you can send.

If your customer is purchasing a device that needs drivers or accompanying software, send
them the links to install it before their product arrives.  If your product has an online manual, let
them know where they can find it!

If you’re selling in Europe where customers request VAT invoices, sending a link to where they
can obtain one is incredibly helpful. It will alleviate the hassle of trying to contact you for an
invoice which can be extremely time consuming for both parties.

Since reviews are equivalent to word of mouth advertising on Amazon, sending links to where
your customer can leave a product review is also a great way to make sure receive as many
reviews as possible.

Follow the spirit of the rule, ‘No Solicitation.’ If you have any other concerns, check out the rules
Amazon has in place.  They can be found under their Policies and Agreements section and
titled Prohibited Seller Activities and Actions.
