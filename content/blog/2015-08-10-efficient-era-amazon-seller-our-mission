Summary: We built one of the more successful Amazon businesses, and want to share our tools to improve your success rate

Amazon offers you all the tools you need to sell and ship anything globally. But with over 200 million products listed on Amazon and over 3 million sellers competing to sell them, it's easy to get lost.  The best product in the world will sit unnoticed without an Amazon-specific selling strategy.

What do you need to break from the pack?

* List products automatically across all the Amazon geographies with automatic transation
* Automatically send a personalized email with support information when a customers' product ships
* Know when a customer gives positive feedback for an order, so you turn that into a potential product review
* Know immediately when a customer has submitted a negative product review so you can reach out to help
* Know when your or a competitors' product changes in sales rank for a category
* Know when your or a competitors' product changes in search rank for important keywords
* Get deeper insights and actionable alerts for increasing or decreasing your Amazon advertising spend
* Plus many more Amazon events and feedback loops that demand your attention

None of these things are capabilities that Amazon provides directly. Yet they're essential to your success.

It's basically all about closing the feedback loop with your customers and with Amazon themselves: knowing immeditely when important events happen, and taking action on that information.

Efficient Era is focused on tools which close this feedback loop. It is a comprehensive set of services to make you successful, built by the team that grew one of the [most successful Amazon global businesses](http://www.cnn.com/2014/09/03/business/thanks-to-amazon-tiny-sellers/index.html). We want to share our tools with you.

Each of our tools is its own microservice. Try one or use them all. Certainly take advantage of our free trial period. We believe we can translate our proven success to your business, too.

As always, let us know if you have any questions at all. Comment below or email [support@efficientera.com](mailto:support@efficientera.com).
