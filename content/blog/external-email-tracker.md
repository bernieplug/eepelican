Summary: Are you building an email list outside of Amazon? If not, it's never too late to get started!

You’ve heard it from the gurus. Don’t put all your eggs in Bezos’ basket. Build your audience through Facebook groups, social media, contests, and the like. At the end of the day, they are your customers, but Amazon won’t let you have them. A lot of sellers are worried about violating Terms of Service by offline marketing activities, and rightfully so. When it comes to Amazon, one strike and you could be out of business. Yet, there are grey areas that most sellers are willing to bet their stakes on. Email list building is one of them.</p>

###Why Build An External Email List
Building an email list has several advantages. The biggest one is that you actually own it. These are people who came to you first, before they bought from you on Amazon. That, by itself, gives you permission to market to them without the fear of a ToS violation. Amazon cannot penalize you for cross-selling, upselling or re-marketing to them because you brought them to Amazon, not the other way around. Once you have built up an engaged audience, you can nurture that relationship by promoting coupons, holding contests and giveaways and keep them coming back to you for more.

###But Did Your Audience Buy From You?
While you are pumping a lot of time, energy and resources into Email List building outside of Amazon, all of your efforts could be fruitless if your audience never bought a thing from you. What you need is a way to match those customers up with real purchases. Does Amazon let you figure that out? No, it doesn’t. Here you are, sending all this great traffic to Amazon from your customer base, but since there is no tracking code that reaches beyond the high walls of Amazon’s enclosures, there is no real way to figure out if they actually made it to the right destination (the buy box on your product page), or if they got distracted by the noise of another Amazon seller.


###A Powerful New Way
We have been working on a way to solve this problem for you. Today, we are announcing our brand new External Email Tracker, a tool that will help you track ‘real world emails’ (as opposed to impossible-to-pronounce Amazon marketplace emails) to see if any sales resulted from them. As always, we match your orders up all the way to the Order Details page. You can start to immediately gauge the effectiveness of your offline efforts since the list is updated multiple times throughout the day.


###Can you match orders placed anytime in the past?
Currently, we match the emails you submitted to orders that were placed within the past 30 days. Soon, we'll add some flexibility to let you give us a date when a list of emails was collected, and match orders up to 90 days from that date.

By monitoring the emails you’ve captured through your landing pages, you can start tracking the effectiveness of your marketing efforts immediately. If your campaigns aren’t seeing any new orders, you can start making adjustments. It’s just one more way to justify your investments and help you boost sales!
