##Keywords are your most important marketing funnels
<p class="Class2">Over 93 percent of all online experiences begin with the use of a search engine. And while the %age might vary a little, over 52% of all shopping queries begin on Amazon. These stats alone should be enough to show just how important it is for you as an Amazon seller to target the right keywords to capture the audience that's looking for YOUR product.
</p>
<p class="Class2">In a way, keywords are like digital signposts. They help ensure that your target customers can find the products that you’re selling and that’s particularly true on Amazon.
</p>
<p class="Class2">With keywords, you can anticipate the wants and desires of the customer to ensure that they find what you’re offering on this mass marketplace.
</p>

##Keywords to draw the right audience
<p class="Class2">If you have some idea about identifying relevant keywords for your products, you will know that long tail keywords are likely to bring you smaller, but higher quality traffic, whereas head keywords will bring you more traffic that may not always be the best fit.
</p>

<p class="Class2">Keyword research is about finding long-tail keywords with relatively high search volume, that have little competition, a steady demand and are highly relevant to your product. Once you identify these target keywords that describe your product the way a buyer would, the goal then is to make sure these are strategically placed throughout your listing, especially in your title, bullet points,  descriptions and back end search terms.
</p>

##Staying on top of search results with keyword ranking
<p class="Class2">Most purchases happen on page 1 and 2 of search results. If your product does not rank for relevant keywords on these two pages, you will be missing out on sales.
</p>

<p class="Class2">One way to get on top of search results is to use Sponsored Products and Headline Search ads. These Pay-per-click (PPC) options will buy you visibility that you can take advantage of to demonstrate to Amazon that you are relevant for those keywords. Sure, they will cost you a pretty penny, but the idea is to train Amazon's algorithm to associate your products with keywords you bid on, so that you can start ranking organically as well.
</p>

<p class="Class2">No one said this would be simple, but fortunately there are quite a few tools that you should add to your arsenal to make this task easier.
</p>

##The Jumbo List of Keyword Tools
<p class="Class2">While no tool can cover all your requirements perfectly, each offers something valuable to make it a little easier for you.
From keyword research, to ranking, to bidding, to new keyword discovery, these tools will help you stay ahead of your competition and win sales. Make sure you create a strategy that gives you the best chance of spinning up the flywheel to push up those sales.
</p>
