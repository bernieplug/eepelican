Summary: When Amazon throws boatloads of data at you, you start to tune out, just a little bit at first. And then, one day you realize...

For a moment, look back to when you started your Amazon store. You were pumped with energy, excited to make more sales and diligently caught and analyzed all the data that Amazon sent your way. Back then, the game of catch was all new and fun and you could cope with it. But as time went by and Amazon continued to throw boatloads of data at you, there came a point when you started to tune out, just a little bit at first. And then, one day you realized, you had literally no way of making sense of all those numbers.

If this story sounds all too familiar and if you continue to be overwhelmed with data scattered all over the place, waiting to be analyzed and acted upon, you are not alone! We get it, because we’ve been there too.

###Seller Central is a Maze and Your Job is Hard
With numerous Amazon reports, pages and listings to keep track of, you might have considered or even tried downloading reports as daily .txt files from Seller Central, to perhaps track all of this information manually. However, things get complicated without automation, especially when Amazon introduces a layer of delay to those numbers, or even updates previous reports that you already downloaded. Then, you need to take on the task of cleaning up and normalizing all this data over time periods and across multiples SKUs and geographies. It’s dirty, hard work- that can take hours of your precious time. But someone has got to do it. Enter the Data Warehouse.

### Efficient Era’s Data Warehouse to the Rescue
Efficient Era’s Data Warehouse acts as a centralized location, importing and gathering all of YOUR data from one or more sources, and transforming it into an easily usable format. Once the data is housed safely on our servers, it is cleaned, formatted, reorganized and summarized, allowing you as an Amazon Seller, to make quick, informed decisions for your business. Our Data Warehouse gives you the ability to easily search, sort, and filter through multiple views (or lists) that we created for you. At the time when this article was written, we provide you with the following different types of searchable lists (and we are constantly adding more):

- Review Changes
- Reviews
- Seller Feedback
- Orders
- Returns
- Promotions
- Promotion Count
- Listings
- Questions

For more advanced users, you are free to use our software as a source of Business Intelligence data, that you can quickly export as .csv or .xls files, which you can then slice-and-dice for advanced analysis. Leverage the Data Warehouse to make informed decisions.
While it is impossible to cover all possible use cases and benefits of Efficient Era's Data Warehouse in one blog post, we’ve covered five important examples here.

### Idea #1: Manually Identify Buyers from Reviews

*Tools you'll need: Review List, Orders List, Amazon Review Page*

If you are aware of our buyer-review matching tool, you know that a lot of the matching between reviewer and buyer is already done for you automatically. We help you find a reviewer’s order and contact information automatically, so you can reach out and offer help. While the most straightforward case of matching in the case of verified purchases is on a customer’s real name, there are cases where our (updated) tool won’t be able to automatically find a match, for example, when reviews are left by anonymous  “Amazon Customers.”

While future versions of our software will be able to match a portion of anonymous matches automatically, there is a lot you can do *manually* today in our system, to locate those buyers yourself. We recommend using a *combination* of our Review List and Orders List to find orders more quickly.

For example, filter all reviews where Nickname is ‘Amazon Customer.’ Next, click on the Review link that takes you to the Amazon page. Click on the customer name in the review. Look for the presence of a wish list. Oftentimes, when you click on the wishlist, it reveals the customer’s real name. Copy the real name and return back to our Orders list. Enter the name and you are likely to find the order associated with it if we have it in our database.

While we used the case of the anonymous ‘Amazon Customer’ as an example, note that our Data Warehouse can also work well in other cases such as when there is a public wedding registry that they have enrolled in. And even when you have only partial name, the Review List and the Orders List let you find orders using partial first names or last names, date ranges when the item might have been purchased, which city it was purchased in, and more.
Our tools cross-index the order and review data as much as possible. This makes them easy to search, so you can quickly find the most reviewers possible and reach out to help them.

### Idea #2: Find Changed Reviews and Ratings
*Tools you'll need: Review Changes List, Review List, Orders List*

While it is important to know who left a review, it is equally important to know if someone dropped their ratings from say, a 5 star to a 1 star. Our Review Changes list helps you see exactly what has changed in terms of both, the rating as well as the text of the review.

Once someone drops their review rating, you do want to contact them and see what went wrong and maybe clear up some misunderstanding about it. Locate that review and review ID in the Review List and find the corresponding match. If there is no match found, follow the steps in Example 2 above to see if you can do this step manually. We are also working on an alert that will let you know when a rating was dropped.

### Idea #3: Check if Your Listings Got Hijacked
*Tools you'll need: Listings List, Alerts Setup*

The Listings List in the Efficient Era Data Warehouse provides a bunch of tracking that can really help you identify problems quickly.  For each ASIN and marketplace, we will tell you which of the following was changed recently.

- Owns Buy Box (Yes/No)
- Brand (Name of Brand that the ASIN is linked to)
- A Plus Listing	 (Yes/No)
- Fulfilled by Amazon (Yes/No)

In addition we provide you with an extensive list of alerts that inform you when any of your listings was changed for some reason. For example, when a hijacker or competitor changed any of the following:

- Title
- Bullet Points
- Images
- Descriptions

Depending on how often you want to be alerted, you can modify your preferences to select as and when or through a daily digest.

### Idea #4: Identify Customers Who Placed Large Orders

*Tool you'll need: Orders List*

The Orders List gives you the ability to specify an "Item Count" to filter on. Once you type in a value for a minimum count, the resulting view can give you interesting insights about which ASINs brought in large orders. What's even more valuable is that we also provide you with Marketplace email IDs along with each order. Again, you can export this view and study the data offline and slice and dice it for more advanced analysis.

### Idea #5: Identify Repeat Customers

*Tools you'll need: Orders List, Excel/Google Sheets*

The best place to track these down is in the “Orders” list. A few quick steps to set filters on the ASIN and specifying a date range is usually enough to narrow your search down to a meaningful list. The next step is to hit export and in a few seconds, you have your .xlsx file ready to analyze.

If you have Excel 2007 or later, you can tell it to highlight duplicate cells, and then sort your “Email" column, by highlight to see all sellers who have bought from you more than once. Here’s a good <a href="https://www.accountingweb.com/technology/excel/identifying-duplicate-values-in-an-excel-list" target="_blank">tutorial</a> in case you do not consider yourself particularly Excel savvy.

###You Don’t Know What You Were Missing Until You Try It
These are only a few ideas we picked from the tons of different ways you can make your data work for you. Borrowing an analogy from today's world, we could say that using Efficient Era’s Data Warehouse is like switching from a legacy phone to a smart phone! You don’t realize you needed it until you use it and then can’t remember what you did without it. The amount of processed, normalized and organized information you can have at your fingertips, is guaranteed to increase your productivity, leaving you more time to focus on the core competencies of your business.
