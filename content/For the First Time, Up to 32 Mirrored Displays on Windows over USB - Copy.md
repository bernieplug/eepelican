Today we're releasing an adapter targeted towards a very specific scenario: multiple mirrored USB displays.
Most home users will not benefit from this product, but for certain scenarios our UGA-M165 (in conjunction with special mDisplay drivers from OSBASE, license included) can be an extremely useful product which allows the user to bypass the Windows limitation of having only a single mirrored display. When designing the product we had several key business applications in mind:
Digital signage
Presentation displays
Information kiosks
Retail displays
A common scenario would be for a conference center, hall, or church where you'd want the same information displayed throughout (perhaps from powerpoint or PDF), all provided by one computer with an available USB connection.
Having the ability to quickly and easily add additional cloned displays of various connector types (HDMI, DVI, VGA, or a mixture thereof) over USB allows for a diverse configuration when compared to conventional VGA/DVI/HDMI cables and splitters. By using these adapters in combination with USB 2.0 hubs and USB 2.0 active extension cables, displays can be placed up to 32 feet away from the host computer and can connect up to 32 displays at once.
There are several considerations that must be made prior to implementing this solution. We would encourage those who are interested in this product to read through the FAQ or contact us with any pre-sales questions. Thanks for going out of your way for Plugable products!
