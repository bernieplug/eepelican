As an Amazon seller, what are your biggest headaches on a day-to-day basis?

If you’re a reseller like most Amazon sellers, your list probably looks something like the following:

<ul>
<li> Stressing over the buy box
<li> Sourcing products to resell
<li> Dealing with thousands of different products (and shipping them too!)
<li> Sweating over razor-thin margins
<li> Worrying about your sales going to Zero in the blink of an eye
</ul>

After a while, many sellers begin treating these issues as necessary evils that come with doing business on Amazon. At seller meetups, rookie sellers will complain about how awful dealing with the buy box is or how low profits are and grizzled veteran sellers will respond with a gruff “Welcome to the club, kid.”

In reality, these headaches aren’t some kind of burden that sellers are duty bound to shoulder. They’re necessities of reselling in general, but not of selling on the Amazon platform.

Does that seem paradoxical? Only if reselling is the only kind of Amazon sales you know.

Imagine this: What if your products could go head to head with the same big name brands that sell on store shelves?

Exciting as it may be, this idea is no fantasy. Many Amazon sellers already accomplish this on every day, by going private label and selling goods under their own independent brand name. If they can do it, so can you.

 Still not convinced? Here are Five key reasons why private label selling beats reselling on Amazon. 

<h2> 1. No more competing for the Buy Box.</h2>
<img class="post-image-right" align="right" src="../../../../theme/img/blog/No-more-buy-box.png" alt="No more buy box" style="height:382px;">

<h3> Reselling </h3>
As you settle down at your desk with your morning coffee and check your Amazon Products, your eye starts to twitch. It’s not the caffeine. It’s seeing that one of your competitors has nabbed the buy box for one of your best-selling products.

This isn’t a rare occurrence for Amazon resellers. It’s an everyday reality. Reselling on Amazon is a constant battle to keep your razor-thin margins safe from the dozens of other resellers nibbling like piranhas at your coveted buy-box spot. 

Keeping the buybox is so crucial that many resellers spend thousands of dollars a month on repricing software that lets them duck and weave under competitor prices. As more and more sellers start to use this service though, a race to the bottom starts. Prices and profits hit rock bottom, and the herd of resellers migrates to greener pastures. Rinse, Repeat, Barely keep in the black.

What if you could have the buy box every time, for every product? No more morning eye-twitches, no more nibbling piranhas. For the veterans of Amazon reselling, this prospect seems no more than a fantasy. No more real than Santa Claus, pigs flying, or Democrats and Republicans working together for a change. 

And they’re right. So long as you’re reselling on Amazon, struggling to keep the buybox is a daily reality. You’re Sisyphus and the buybox is your rock.

<h3> Private label </h3>
Enter Private label, or branded selling: The world where always having the buybox is not only a possibility but a reality. Even a necessity. When you’re selling your own product, you’re the king of your own hill. If reselling is having a broom closet in a tenement, branded selling is owning the building. No more daily buy box stress.

Of course, it’s not all sunshine and daisies. As Spiderman’s Uncle Ben famously says, “With great power comes great responsibility”. Notably, having your own product page means <a href= Start-Paying-Attention-To-Your-Amazon-Product-Reviews.html> managing product reviews  and taking the lead in getting your product seen.</a>

Still, having your own brand beats reselling unambiguously on this count. Besides, work spent building your own line of products is infinitely more rewarding than time in the rat pack chasing the buy box.

<h2>2. Carve a niche from what you know best.</h2>
<img class="post-image-right" align="right" src="../../../../theme/img/blog/Sell-what-you-want-to-sell-Amazon.png" alt="Sell what you want to sell Amazon" style="height:300px;">
<h3> Reselling </h3>
Ask a typical reseller what kind of products he sells and he’ll likely laugh in your face. The reality is that resellers sell whatever they can manage to get their hands on that will bring in a profit. On Amazon, burly, bearded lumberjack types sell lipstick and hello kitty binders, while basement bound geeks may find themselves selling powertools and fashionable apparel.

Unfortunately, this broad scope comes with a cost. Sellers don’t have the know-how to address customer questions, let alone complaints caused by defects. Buyers get frustrated because they expect competent service, and sellers get frustrated because they burn time trying to fix something they don’t know or care about. It’s a losing proposition on both sides.


<h3> Private label </h3>

What if all Amazon sellers sold what they most cared about? The lumberjacks can sell axes and flannel shirts, while the geeks can sell computer parts and trading cards. This way, quality of inventory is checked while it’s being sourced, and can be addressed again if the customer has any concerns. 

The seller also gets to deal in something he’s passionate about. A hobby can turn into a full-fledged business. This type of small business was thought to be dead with the advent of big box stores like Walmart. Gone, so the narrative goes, are the days of the guitarist owned guitar shop and the engineer owned computer shop.

With Amazon private label selling, that vision is a reality to the benefit of both buyers and sellers. Buyers can expect quality products and helpful from knowledgeable branded sellers. Sellers leverage their specific knowledge to anticipate buyer needs, massively boosting profits compared to the blind-shooting of reselling. 

Selling products you don’t know about must be reactive by necessity, following the herd from fad to fad. Selling from your niche of expertise means the trends start with you.

Once again, a couple words of watchful warning. Even when selling what you know best, you have to sell what customers actually want. It can be easy to get emotionally invested in pet projects that don’t help your business (blog post here). Learn to be adaptable while still staying true to your knowledge base/

<h2>3. Easier Management with less products </h2>
<img class="post-image-right" align="right" src="../../../../theme/img/blog/Too-many-amazon-ASINs.png" alt="Too many amazon ASINs" style="height:382px;">
<h3> Reselling </h3>

The number of unique ASINs that Amazon resellers must sell to make any kind of reasonable revenue is in the thousands. What with buy box woes, unpredictable demand, frequent out of stock situations, diversification is a necessity.  The result? Constant headaches. 

A large number of products means:

<ol>
<li>More time sourcing new products
<li>More time managing listings and prices
<li>More time shipping and handling
<li>More time spent handling customer queries
</ol>

The list could go on.

<h3> Private label </h3>

With private label sales, a seller with under 100 unique products can easily reach 7 figures of revenue. In fact, one product alone can easily manage 6 figures of revenue with hard work and some luck. 

Less products to manage means:

<ol>
<li>Less time sourcing many products, with higher quality products
<li>Less time managing listing and pricing, with more optimization
<li>Less time shipping, and better use of Amazon’s powerful FBA network (blog post here)
<li>Less time spent handling customer queries, with laser-focus support.
</ol>

Simply put, branded selling means less tedious management and more meaningful management. To be blunt, becoming a successful branded selling involves no less work than successful reselling. The same hour devoted to branded selling, however, is more meaningful and provides better results.

<h2> 4. See your profits skyrocket </h2>
<img class="post-image-right" align="right" src="../../../../theme/img/blog/Revenue-vs-cost-Amazon-reselling-vs-private-label.png" alt="Revenue vs cost Amazon reselling vs private label" style="height:382px;">

<h3> Reselling </h3>

We’ve already mentioned that retailing on Amazon is a race to the bottom from the get go. Even worse, the products must be bought from wholesalers rather than directly from the manufacturer, meaning another middleman and higher costs. Low revenue and high costs. You do the math.

Low profits means that selling becomes a means to pad income, rather than an entrepreneurial opportunity. 
<h3> Private label </h3>

On the revenue side, private label sellers are able to charge more, and deservedly so. With the backing of a trusted, brand, the quality of a product and more critically the quality of customer support is assured. Besides, no buy box competition means that you set the price you believe your product deserves.

On the cost side, private label sellers pay less. Resellers from wholesalers who buy from manufacturers who are under contract of a big name brand. Private label sellers buy directly from the manufacturer, often with custom specifications. The result? Products over which you have direct quality control, at a lower price.

Private Label selling leads to higher revenue and lower costs. Once again, we’ll let you do the math. 

While higher profits might seem to signal fast cars and huge houses (and it may eventually) savvy business people know the best use of the excess: reinvestment. With higher profits, every extra dollar earned doesn’t necessarily equate to extra spending money, though it can. Instead, it allows you to infuse your new brand with capital, turning it from a hobby to business.

<h2> 5. Build a lasting, respected brand. </h2>
<img class="post-image-right" align="right" src="../../../../theme/img/blog/private-label-amazon.png" alt="private label amazon" style="height:382px;">

Perhaps the most important yet most underestimated asset of any business is its reputation. Reputation is so important that big corporations spend hundreds of millions of dollars on PR firms that gloss and polish their every action and product for public consumption.

Unfortunately, we don’t have that luxury as Amazon sellers. Despite this, positive consumer perception is more critical for small businesses than it is for established corporations. It’s business life or death. A bad reputation means certain rapid failure. On the other hand, building a good reputation in the eyes of consumers paves the way for incredible business success.

<h3> Reselling </h3>

The only reputation Amazon resellers can establish is through their seller feedback rating. Amazon factors this rating into their search results and buy box algorithms. More visibly, if consumers bother to look beyond the buybox, the “Other Offers” page allows a direct comparison between sellers by their feedback rating. Finally, consumers often click through to the company page to view feedback directly. 

Private label sellers must also pay attention to seller feedback, mostly in relation to Amazon’s search ranking algorithm (blog post here). Thus, maintaining high feedback ratings is <a href=/seller-feedback.html> critical to success both as a reseller and as a branded seller </a>

Besides this one statistic, however, resellers never have the opportunity to really build a lasting brand. Nobody remembers that they bought a Nike shoe or a used book from Lots O’ Stuff Inc. .  At best, your relationship with the customer ends once their package arrives. Any repeat sales are pure chance in the massive ocean of the Amazon Marketplace. 

The sad reality is that if your resale company disappeared tomorrow, not one customer would notice. A fallen tree in an abandoned forest of resellers reaching to steal the precious sunshine of customer sales from each other.
<h3> Private label </h3>

Branded Sales are a whole different ballgame. If you’ve done things right, the sudden disappearance of your company should prompt “sky-is-falling” despair among your niche of loyal customers. Even the cool-heads at Amazon HQ will note your disappearance with some dismay.

One core means by which this reputation is established through Amazon Product Reviews. You’ll find our in depth post <a href=/Start-paying-attention-to-your-Amazon-Product-Reviews.html>on them valuable if you’re a branded seller or are planning on becoming me. </a>

Broadly speaking, private label selling on Amazon means building a long lasting reputation and brand. Every product you sell has your name and logo on it. Every customer interaction you have, good and bad, is associated with your name. Every product review speaks not only to your product, but to your company at large.

 Consumers remember you and speak to their friends and family about your products. Your logo might sit somewhere on their desk or kitchen counter everyday. In some small way, you’ve become a part of the consumer’s daily life.
 
<h2> Conclusions </h2>

Once again, let’s go to Spiderman’s Uncle Ben: “With Great Power comes Great Responsibility”. With dedication, a private label brand can be cultivated into the rock solid foundation of a thriving e-commerce business. Instead of stagnating year to year with resales, you’ll see your business grow year after year, like a rolling snowball. 

Before you know it, competitors will be glaring at you with envy as you sit atop Amazon search results across your line of products. You’ll be the miniature scale, Amazon exclusive version of Coke, Ford, or Nike. 

So what are you waiting for? Go Private label!
