            <h2>Power Tools for Power Sellers</h2>
            <p>E-commerce is changing retail as we know it. Just a decade ago, “small business owner” and “global seller” were mutually exclusive. With the explosion of e-commerce and especially the Amazon Marketplace, the world is a different place. Small business owners have been placed on equal footing with the previously undefeated giant corporations.The internet has enabled the opening of this new era in retail.</p>

                                Our Review Notifications Tool automatically sends out alerts each time you receive a product or seller review.
                                From there, you can quickly respond to customers, especially if they left a negative review.

                              With the ever changing Amazon SERP algorithm, it’s important for sellers to know exactly which keywords they are ranking for.
                                Our Keyword Ranking tool allows you to provide a keyword list and then monitor your performance against that list
                                over time. This can be a very powerful input to refining your listing and running PPC campaigns.

                                In order to monitor how your products are performing over a period of time, it’s vital to be able to
                                visualize your sales data. Our Sales Charts do that for you, but there’s more! They also allow you to
                                annotate your data with custom events, such as a coupon campaign you launched or a holiday event
                                that you know could have impacted your performance.

                                Your product could be listed in multiple categories, and those categories might also evolve over time.
                                Knowing how your products are performing across various categories over time on the same chart can provide
                                useful insights for category placements, a powerful tool if used the right way.

                            We’ve all been there, and we know how stressful it can be - running out of stock is a problem many sellers deal with.
                                One of the first, yet most important bulwarks against stock-outs is a low stock notification system.
