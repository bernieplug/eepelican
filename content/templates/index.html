            <h2>Power Tools for Power Sellers</h2>
            <p>E-commerce is changing retail as we know it. Just a decade ago, “small business owner” and “global seller” were mutually exclusive. With the explosion of e-commerce and especially the Amazon Marketplace, the world is a different place. Small business owners have been placed on equal footing with the previously undefeated giant corporations.The internet has enabled the opening of this new era in retail.</p>

                                If you’re just relying on Amazon, there’s no way for you to know if you received a large order.
                                With our Bulk Order Notification tool, you define how large a “bulk order” should be,
                                and our tool will notify you whenever you receive one.

                            <p>A buyer leaves you a one-star review. How do you contact them to find out what went wrong and if you can do anything to make any amends? Efficient Era's Buyer Reviewer matching tool accurately links verified reviews to orders and helps you directly contact buyers.
                                Our review notification alerts contain direct links to the review page and to the order details page on Amazon.

                                These annotations give context to sales spikes and dips.

                <p>In a shocking, yet somewhat inevitable turn of events, Amazon has announced that it is completely banning all discounted reviews, except for those provided by the Vine program, which is only available to Amazon Retail, that too at a very high price point. How is the average marketplace seller, with no access to the Vine program expected to solve the so called "cold-start" problem? </p>
                <p>If you are a marketplace seller interested to learn how to survive Amazon's policy changes without risking any violation of their ToS OR gaming the system, then this Webinar with Bernie Thompson is for you! </p>
