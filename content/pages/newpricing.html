<h3>Starting Jan 1st, 2017 our pricing model is undergoing a change!</h3>
            <p> From Tiered Pricing to Variable Pricing, we have changed things up quite a bit, so
                we can serve your needs even better!
                Our new pricing model is based on your usage of our services. We only think this is fair.</p>

            <p> For the same price, you can get access to our entire toolset. We do not offer separate pricing
                plans for individual tools. You are free to pick the ones that are most appropriate to your requirements.
                Here is our current set of tools, with their full functionality available to you to try for free under our 60-day trial period:
                <ul class="fa-ul">
                <li class=""><i class="fa-li fa fa-check-square"></i>Buyer-Reviewer Matching</li>
                <li class=""><i class="fa-li fa fa-check-square"></i>Review Notifications</li>
                <li class=""><i class="fa-li fa fa-check-square"></i>Seller Feedback Notifications</li>
                <li class=""><i class="fa-li fa fa-check-square"></i>Email Automation</li>
                <li class=""><i class="fa-li fa fa-check-square"></i>Sales Charts with Event Annotations</li>
                <li class=""><i class="fa-li fa fa-check-square"></i>VAT Invoice Automation</li>
                <li class=""><i class="fa-li fa fa-check-square"></i>Bulk Order Notification</li>

                    </ul>
                If you were grandfathered into our old (tiered) plan, you should have received an email from us in October.
                If not, this new pricing plan applies to you. </p>

            Billing will be based on the peak number of ASINs and orders during the monthly billing cycle which,
            starts on the 1st of each month.</p>

        <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

        <h4>Q: Who is the intended audience of Efficient Era Tools?</h4>
        <p>Our software is targeted primarily towards Private Label Sellers using Fulfilment By Amazon (FBA) services. We offer a range of tools for real-time notifications, actionable analytics and process automation.</p>

        <h4>Q: How will I be charged?</h4>
        <p>You will be required to set up Amazon Payments (one time setting). Once your account has been authorized, billing will
            happen automatically and you will be sent an invoice each month based on your usage.</p>

        <h4>Q: How often will I be billed?</h4>
        <p>You will billing on the 1st of every month. If your 60-day trial ends in the middle of a month,
            we will combine the first month's payment with the following month.</p>

        <h4>Q: Do I need to provide you with credit card details during the free trial?</h4>
        <p>
            No, you will never need to provide us any credit card information during or after your trial period.
            We will require you to complete your setup of Amazon Payments when we send you the first notice of payment.
        </p>

        <h4>Q: What is Amazon Payments? Can I use Paypal or a credit card instead?</h4>
        <p>At this point, the only form of payment we accept is via Amazon Payments. It is a trusted service for both shoppers
            and merchants and you can read up more about it <a href="https://payments.amazon.com/shopper" target="_blank" style="color: darkorange">here</a>.
        </p>


        <h4>Q: How do you handle account cancellations?</h4>
        <p>Once you cancel your order we will remove your account from our system.
            You will need to disable permissions for Efficient Era from Seller Central.
            Your last monthly bill be charged to you on the 1st of the following month.
        </p>


        <h4>Q: Can I trust Efficient Era with access to my seller account?</h4>
        <p>We, at Efficient Era take security very seriously. All passwords are encrypted using PBKDF2 algorithm with a SHA256 hash. Your Amazon credentials are encrypted with AES-GCM 256-bit encryption.
        Also, we use two-factor authentication to log into servers and services. All servers have firewalls, and we apply security updates regularly.</p>

        <h4>Q: What does “Buyer-Reviewer Matching” mean? How does that help me?</h4>
        <p>Efficient Era believes that contacting reviewers to address negative reviews is a hugely important part of running a successful Amazon business, and so we have developed extremely reliable buyer-reviewer software to help remedy this problem. Other companies have tried to offer solutions to this problem but their methods are often unreliable, either connecting the review to the incorrect buyer or not finding the buyer at all. Efficient Era’s software is much more consistent, allowing you to find the buyer associated with the review every time and reach out to address the problem.</p>


        <h4>Q: Can I track my competition with your tools?</h4>
        <p>Yes, you can add your competitor’s products by ASIN number to track the positive and negative reviews that they receive as part of product or seller feedback. We recommend that you create a separate account with us in order to track your competition so that you can manage your dashboard and notifications frequency separately.</p>

        <h4>Q: What is VAT Invoice Automation?</h4>
        <p>Our web tool allows your customers to request VAT invoices directly, without having to contact your customer service. It gathers the needed data for the invoice from your customer and from Amazon, generates the VAT invoice PDF they need, and automatically mails it to the them within seconds. We enable sending a link to this tool as part of an email sent automatically when each order ships.</p>

        <h4>Q: How do you determine VAT rates for different countries?</h4>
        <p>We keep track of VAT rates for each country.</p>

        <h4>Q: What aspect of the customization of follow-up emails can I control?</h4>
        <p>You can now fully customize the body text of any email campaign with HTML and inline CSS, and add custom themes so that company-wide messages are displayed in all your emails. To control when exactly the email is sent, you can set triggers based on order confirmation, shipment, and/or delivery, along with a delay in days.</p>

        <h4>Q: What kind of alerts do you provide?</h4>
        <p>Each time you receive a new review, a negative review, a large order or when your inventory is low, you will receive an automatic notification in your inbox. You can opt out of receiving automatic notifications in favor of a weekly digest.

<h3> Here's what our customers are saying about us!</h3>
            <p>
            "We were looking for a service to help us match Amazon reviews with customer orders and came across Efficient Era.  I was instantly impressed with the intuitive layout of the dashboards and accessibility of information.  Once I added the products that I wanted to track I was blown away that close to 100% of our product reviews were linked back to a customer order!  This is by far the best service for matching customer review to Amazon orders - nothing else that we have used even comes close.  Add in all the other great features like product sales charts with price change and event indicators, downloadable large order reports, and more - this is an incredible tool for delivering actionable, accessible data to anyone who sells on Amazon." ~ Devin Kelly, <a href = "http://softy.com">www.softy.com</a></p>

            <p>
            "I love the large order email from Efficient Era.  I use this to keep an eye on my FBA inventory levels and also to help me see when I need to add a listing with larger quantities to give my customer a better value." ~ Kathy M.</p>

            <p>"I have fallen in love with this software much to my partner and childrens dismay ;-)" ~ Dr P Proctor MRCVS, SimplyPetsOnline Limited</p>
