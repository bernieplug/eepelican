            Here is a sample email sent automatically each time a purchase is made for a
            product named PC-Glass. There are 2 main parts to how the email is composed: Theme and the Campaign.
            Further, there are three specific fields that you need to enter text into:</p>
            <ul class="fa-ul">
                <li class=""><i class="fa-li fa fa-check-square"></i>Title : The subject line</li>
                <li class=""><i class="fa-li fa fa-check-square"></i>Email Body : The main body of the email</li>
                <li class=""><i class="fa-li fa fa-check-square"></i>Theme Body : The footer that goes on every email that uses this theme</li>
            </ul>
        <p>
        <img src="/images/pages/sturdycases.png" width = "90%" class="img-thumbnail" alt="Email Template">
        </p>
        </div>

        <h3>Building your Email</h3>
        <p>Here is how you would actually build a mail like the one above using placeholder text. All the text that is enclosed in square
        brackets is a "placeholder". This will be replaced by the actual text at the point when the email is actually sent out.
        You can use this template as a starting point and change the text as appropriate. More placeholders can be found on the text formatting toolbar.</p>
