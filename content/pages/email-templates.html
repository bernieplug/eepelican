            <p>Each Email Campaign can be styled with pre-created themes.

                <p>
                Themes: In general, we recommend you start with one of our pre-created themes:</p>

                <p><span style="color: blue">Post Order Theme</span>: A simple HTML based theme with the ability to add images and links</p>

                <p class="text-center"><img src="/images/pages/Post Order Theme 2.png"></p>
                <p><span style="color: blue">Simple Theme</span>: A simple HTML based theme with <strong>no styling</strong> with the ability to add images and links</p>

                Advanced: You can also create more advanced themes with your own HTML styling but we do not recommend it for beginners.

            <p>You can manage the timing of when you would like an email campaign to be sent out based on triggers and delays. Efficient Era offers three types of triggers per campaign.
                Plus you can always add additional days delays to them. Here is a description of our triggers:
                <p>
                <p><span style="color: blue">Confirmed</span>: The order was placed. We can gather this information from Amazon right away. </p>
                <p><span style="color: blue">Shipped</span>: The order was shipped. For FBA orders, Amazon's information about this is accurate.
                    For MFN orders it is not. Allow for possible delays.</p>
                <p><span style="color: blue">Delivered</span>: A tentative trigger of when the item was delivered. Note, since this is an
                    estimate we get from Amazon, allow enough gap before you schedule an email with this. Add enough delay days.
                </p>

                <p>Amazon TOS: Amazon recommends limiting the amount of communication with buyers. Ideally, send 1 or
                    no more than two emails per order</p>

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-lg-6 col-lg-offset-3">

        <strong><h4>Q: What's the difference between All Products and Default Campaigns?    </h4></strong>
        <p>A <strong>Default Campaign</strong> is one that will be sent out for those products that have NO other campaigns associated with them. Once you enable the Default Campaign mode, you will not be able to attach specific products to it.

        <p>An <strong>All Products Campaign</strong> (where you leave the Products field blank) is one that will be sent for ALL products, even if that product is associated with other Email Campaigns.

        <p>Default campaigns tend to be used by companies that send one email, customized per product, but want to make sure they have a backup email that will always go out, even if they choose or forget to add a customized campaign for a new product.

        <p>An All Products Email Campaign tends to be used by companies that are sending the same email as part of a series of several emails over time, for all products.</p>



        <strong><h4>Q: Can I send multiple Emails for the same product?</h4></strong>
        <p>Yes, you can. Let's say you want to send an email right after a purchase was confirmed, and one after it was delivered. You could create one Thank-You email and one Follow-Up email with the same set of products but different event triggers.</p>



        <strong><h4>Q: Why aren't my emails sending?</h4></strong>
        <p>If you suspect your emails aren't sending, it could be due to a missing permission. Please make sure that noreply@efficientera.com is enabled as an authorized sender in the Messages section of your Seller Central.</p>



        <strong><h4>Q: How can I tell if my Emails are being sent out correctly</h4></strong>
        <p>One place to check that emails are being sent from Efficient Era to Amazon, is to access the Sent Email Chart sub-menu.</p>

        <p>To test if your Emails are getting sent out correctly from Amazon, access the Buyer-Seller messages outbox here.</p>

        <p>Note: Your emails will only get sent to Amazon once they hit an event trigger. For example, if your Email Trigger is set to Delivered + 2 Days then please check your Seller Central outbox when the first order that comes in after you signed up for Efficient Era is likely to get delivered + 2 days. Typically, this is 7-10 days from purchase.</p>



        <strong><h4>Q: Can I send emails in different languages for different marketplaces?</h4></strong>
        <p>Yes, you can! Let's say you have an ASIN that you sell in different marketplaces (say US and FR) and would like to customize your email campaigns in different languages. You could set up one email campaign for the Amazon.com marketplace, and type your email text in English. And you could set up another email for the Amazon.fr market and select the same ASIN or set of ASINs for it but type in you email body text in French.</p>
        <p class="text-center"><img src="/images/pages/markets.png" style="width: 80%"></p>


        <strong><h4>Q: Does Efficient Era send out emails for past orders (before sign up)?</h4></strong>
        <p>No. We currently do not have the ability to send emails for orders placed before you signed up for our service.</p>



        <strong><h4>Q: How do I sent up large order alerts?</h4></strong>
        <p>If you would like to be notified each time you receive a Large Order, follow these configuration steps:</p>

        <p>Click Email Automation Settings at the bottom of our sub menu. Scroll down to enable the Large Order Notifications section. Enable the Large Order Notifications button. Specify the email recipients and define the Order Quantity Threshold for what you consider a large order.</p>



        <strong><h4>Q: Do Placeholders get replaced with actual values?</h4></strong>
        <p>Yes! You can weave Placeholders into your email text, which are enclosed in square brackets (e.g. [SellerSKU]). These get replaced dynamically by real values, at the time when the email is being sent.</p>



        <strong><h4>Q: Can I send a test mail through Efficient Era?</h4></strong>
        <p>Use the Preview button located at the right top corner of the Emails tool in Edit mode. You can send this email to yourself by providing your email address. Note, that since we do not have actual order details at this point, some of the details about the product will either be dummy values or one of your products picked randomly. Rest assured, your placeholders will get replaced with the correct values pulled from your actual orders.</p>



        <strong><h4>Q: Why is my Email Campaign not saving?</h4></strong>
        <p>This is likely because some values are missing. The most common reason is that you have not selected a marketplace for that email. It could also be that you are trying to attach disabled products. In this case, either enable those products from the Products menu or simply remove all disabled products that look like () x.</p>



        <strong><h4>Q: How do I view my Email Open rates?</h4></strong>
        <p>Click the Emails Sent Chart sub-menu to view your aggregate Sent versus Opened email rates.</p>
