        <h3>Welcome to Efficient Era!</h3>
        <p>We are excited to have you use our software. In order to derive maximum benefit from our ever growing set of tools, we have put together a recommended sequence of steps to follow. </p>


        <h4>1. Complete MWS Authorization</h4>
        <p>Our software relies on MWS APIs to gather your data and send emails on your behalf. If you haven't activated your account yet, simply log into Efficient Era and follow the instructions for MWS authorization.</p>
        <p>Note: If you are using Efficient Era for Japan only please note that you will need either and Amazon.com or Amazon.co.uk account.</p>

        <p></p>

        <h4>2. Set up Alerts</h4>
        <p>Efficient Era offers broad range of alerts such as Listing Hijack Alerts, Sales Alerts,
            Product Review Alerts and more to help you stay on top of your business. This is a list of alerts we support:</p>
        <img src="/images/pages/ee_alerts.png" class="img-responsive" alt="Listing Hijack Alerts" style="width: 40%;"></img>
        <p>You can adjust the frequency of alerts to one that you prefer. By default all of these alerts are set to "off".</p>
        <p>There are a few alerts that are enabled by default. These are:</p>

        <ul class="fa-ul">
            <li class=""><i class="fa-li fa fa-check-square"></i>Product Review Alerts (daily)</li>
            <li class=""><i class="fa-li fa fa-check-square"></i>Seller Feedback (daily)</li>
            <li class=""><i class="fa-li fa fa-check-square"></i>Question Alerts (weekly)</li>
            <li class=""><i class="fa-li fa fa-check-square"></i>Large Order Alerts (daily)</li>
        </ul>

<p>If you would like to change these frequencies simply access the tool page, and you will be able to find tool specific settings in the top right area.</p>


        <p></p>

        <h4>3. Create Follow-up Email Campaigns <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo-CeLkYqX4" target="_blank">(Watch Video)</a> </h4>
            <p>Emails are a great way to provide customer support and also request for reviews. Your email campaigns can be set to trigger each time a product was purchased, shipped or delivered. Define the layout and formatting of the email as you like. To enable and design Email Campaigns, access Email Automation settings within the Email Automator tool and make sure the follow-up email button is enabled. Also, choose the marketplaces you would like automation to be enabled for.
            </p>

        <p>In order for our Email Automator can start using Amazon's buyer-seller messaging system to send follow-up emails you need to add noreply@efficientera.com to the list of approved senders on Amazon</p>

        <p>The steps are:</p>
        <p>
            <ul class="fa-ul">
            <li class=""><i class="fa-li fa fa-check-square"></i>From Seller Central Settings select Messages in the top right area</li>
            <li class=""><i class="fa-li fa fa-check-square"></i>Select Authorized Emails</li>
        <br>
            <img src="/images/pages/authorizedSender.png" class="img-responsive" alt="Tools for Amazon Sellers" style="width: 40%;"></img>
            </br><li class=""><i class="fa-li fa fa-check-square"></i>Add noreply@efficientera.com to the list of approved senders</li>
                <br>


            <img src="/images/pages/noreply.png" class="img-responsive" alt="Tools for Amazon Sellers" style="width: 40%;"></img>
            </ul>
        </p>
            <h4>4. Set up Bulk Order Alerts</h4>
            <p>While you are in the Email Automation settings (same as the previous step), you can specify how you would like to be notified each time there is a bulk order. Specify what you consider a bulk order. We have set it to default value of 10 but you can change this at any time. </p>


        <h4>5. Modify Product Details</h4>
        <p>Products are detected automatically from Amazon. By default, the listing title on Amazon is the display name within Efficient Era. However, sometimes these titles can be fairly long when selecting them in dropdowns or settings. Feel free to edit these display names. These will only affect how your product is displayed within Efficient Era. In order to change display names, access Product Settings from the gear icon under your username in the top right corner of any page. You can also upload product details via csv.</p>

        <p>Once in the Product Settings page, you can provide us with the landed cost of your ASINs. This will be useful in displaying profit calculations in the Efficient Era dashboard.</p>

          <p>Note: Since we auto-detect your products from Amazon, based on a listing report that we request, you might start noticing a new type of daily notification from Amazon letting you know that this report was requested. Since this alert can get noisy for some people, we recommend switching it off by going to Seller Central, access Notifications under your account name and then deselect
