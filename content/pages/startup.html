        <h4>Welcome to Efficient Era!</h4>
        <p>We are excited to have you use our software. In order to derive maximum benefit from our ever growing set of tools, we have put together a recommended sequence of steps to follow. You may, of course, chose to skip certain steps if you would only like to use parts of our toolset.</p>


        <h3>Account Setup</h3>
            <h4>Account Activation and Login</h4>
            <p>Confirm your account by replying to the mail sent to you by noreply@efficientera.com.
                Bookmark the landing page at <a href="https://app.efficientera.com/" target="_blank"> app.efficientera.com</a> to have quick access to all the tools. When logging in, remember, your username is not your email address unless you specified your email address as your username. Also, the username is case sensitive. Once set, your username cannot be changed but your display name can.</p>


            <h4>Amazon Marketplace Web Services (MWS) Authorization</h4>
            In order for you to access all the features of our tool, you will need set up your MWS account and provide Efficient Era developer access to it.


            <h4>Seller Central Integration</h4>
            <p>Perform this step in conjunction with the MWS Authorization step. The only feature that will work even without this information is the Product Reviews. </p>
            <p>Please refer to <a href="https://efficientera.com/blog/2015/08/registering-your-amazon-account-with-mws.html" target="_blank">this document</a> to perform the last two steps above.</p>


            <h3>Using Efficient Era Features</h3>
            <p>Once you log in to Efficient Era, you will see a dashboard of the various tools we provide. Some of these tools may be in Alpha or Beta versions or may not display any data in case you have not completed your MWS and Seller Central Integrations.</p>


            <h4>Product Setup <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUgZGg_T2HE" target="_blank">(Watch Video)</a></h4>
            <p>Set up products to track. This is the first step you need to do in order to get data about your products. You can either set up products one at a time or auto-populate from your seller central account. In order for you to do a bulk import, you will need to complete all the steps in the Account Setup step. Note that once you have set up products it will take upto 1 day for you to start seeing data on your Review dashboard.</p>


            <h4>Product Reviews</h4>
            Once you set up products (step above) you will be able to access reviews for them within a day. We also provide the unique ability to match a review to an order and then let you connect with the buyer who made the purchase. However, this feature is enabled for only those products that were ordered on Amazon and only after your MWS Authorization and Seller Central Integration for Efficient Era are completed. Once setup, you can use our search tools to access reviews by products, by keywords, by star ratings or by marketplace within a date range. Click on a review to access the orders that it was associated with to connect directly with the buyer.


            <h4>Seller Feedback</h4>
            <p>Our Seller Feedback tool gives you email notifications, dashboard based analytics of your seller performance, as well the ability to send automated mails each time you receive a positive or negative Seller Feedback. To use this feature you will need to perform Seller Central Integration.</p>

            <h4>Follow-up Email Automation <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVFhAn4xAeQ" target="_blank">(Watch Video)</a> </h4>
            <p>Set up multiple automatic triggered campaigns so that you can connect with your customers when a product was purchased, when it was shipped and when it was delivered. Define the layout and formatting of the email as you like.</p>


            <h4>Sales and Rankings Charts</h4>
            <p>Create events to mark the dates when special actions were taken by you that you think might have had an impact on your sales. For example, a special campaign you ran or a promotion.</p>


            <h4>VAT Invoice Automation <a href="https://efficientera.com/guide-vat/" target="_blank">(Read Documentation) </a> <a href="https://youtu.be/JsjAsQgSpwk" target="_blank">(Watch Video)</a></h4>
            <p>If you sell in Europe and need to help your customers generate VAT invoices. Provide your VAT registration number and countries in which you are VAT registered.</p>


            <h3>Notifications Setup</h3>
            <p>All of our notification settings can be accessed on individual pages by accessing the Settings gear box located towards the top right corner of each tool page. Here are some examples of the settings you could make:</p>


            <h4>Product Review Settings</h4>
            <p>Would you like to be notified each time you have a review? Would you like one daily digest email instead of one email per new review with details of each review? By default, you will receive a weekly digest. For negative reviews set the star level below which you want to be notified.</p>


            <h4>Email Automation Settings</h4>
            <p>Set up marketplaces that you would like to enable for this service for.</p>


            <h4>Bulk Order Settings</h4>
            <p>Specify what you consider a bulk order. This number varies according to the business. This is so you can be notified when a single order is placed that exceeds the number specified.</p>


            <p>We are constantly working on improving our products and our documentation, so please feel free to let us know what features you would like to see and also if you find our instructions clear.</p>
