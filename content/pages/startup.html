        <h3>Welcome to Efficient Era!</h3>
        <p>We are excited to have you use our software. In order to derive maximum benefit from our ever growing set of tools, we have put together a recommended sequence of steps to follow. You may, of course, chose to skip certain steps if you would only like to use parts of our toolset.</p>


<!--        <h3>Account Setup</h3>
            <h4>Account Activation and Login</h4>
            <p>Confirm your account by replying to the mail sent to you by noreply@efficientera.com.
                Bookmark the landing page at <a href="https://app.efficientera.com/" target="_blank"> app.efficientera.com</a> to have quick access to all the tools. When logging in, remember, your username is not your email address unless you specified your email address as your username. Also, the username is case sensitive. Once set, your username cannot be changed but your display name can.</p>


            <h4>Amazon Marketplace Web Services (MWS) Authorization</h4>
            In order for you to access all the features of our tool, you will need set up your MWS account and provide Efficient Era developer access to it.


            <h4>Seller Central Integration</h4>
            <p>Perform this step in conjunction with the MWS Authorization step. The only feature that will work even without this information is the Product Reviews. </p>
            <p>Please refer to <a href="https://efficientera.com/blog/2015/08/registering-your-amazon-account-with-mws.html" target="_blank">this document</a> to perform the last two steps above.</p>
-->

            <h3>Using Efficient Era Features</h3>
            <p>Once you log in to Efficient Era, you will see a dashboard of the various tools we provide. Some of these tools may be in Alpha or Beta versions or may not display any data in case you have not completed your MWS and Seller Central Integrations.</p>


            <h4>Product Setup <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZEdAIVprmE" target="_blank">(Watch Video)</a></h4>
            <p>Set up products to track. If you are an FBA seller, all your products will be automatically
                imported for you. If you are an FBM seller, products will be added as an order is detected for them.
                You could also upload your entire list of ASINs manually via a spreadsheet upload.

                </p>

            <h4>Buyer Review Matching and Product Reviews <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTKbGCA9Epk" target="_blank">(Watch Video)</a></h4>
            Once you set up products (step above) you will be able to access reviews for them within a day.
            We also provide the unique ability to match a review to an order and then let you connect with the buyer who made the purchase. However, this feature is enabled for only those products that were ordered on Amazon and only after your MWS Authorization and Seller Central Integration for Efficient Era are completed. Once setup, you can use our search tools to access reviews by products, by keywords, by star ratings or by marketplace within a date range. Click on a review to access the orders that it was associated with to connect directly with the buyer.
            </p>

            <h4>Seller Feedback Automation & Alerts</h4>
            <p>Our Seller Feedback tool gives you email notifications, dashboard based analytics of your seller performance,
                as well the ability to send automated mails each time you receive a positive or negative Seller Feedback.
                To use this feature you will need to perform Seller Central Integration. Access Automatic Replies and Settings
                from the Seller Feedback dashboard.</p>

            <h4>Follow-up Email Automation <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo-CeLkYqX4" target="_blank">(Watch Video)</a> </h4>
            <p>Set up multiple automatic triggered campaigns so that you can connect with your customers. Your campaigns can be set
                to trigger each time a product was purchased, shipped or delivered. Define the layout and formatting of the email as you like.
                To enable and design Email Campaigns, you first need to access Order Automation settings on the Email Automation dashboard
                and make sure the follow-up email button is enabled. Also, choose the marketplaces you would like automation for.
            </p>

            <h4>Bulk Order Settings</h4>
            <p>While you are in the Order Automation settings (same as the previous step), you can specify how you would like to be
                notified each time there is a bulk order. Specify what you consider a bulk order. We have set it to default
                value of 10 but you can change this at any time. </p>


            <h4>Inventory Health Charts<a href="https://youtu.be/M6hELJZ9J2w?list=PLUYdN3DukWcJz0YGzj3QHLCjI7aIdPyiC" target="_blank"> (Watch Video)</a> </h4>
            <p>Create events to mark the dates when special actions were taken by you that you think might have had an impact on your sales. For example, a special campaign you ran or a promotion.</p>


            <h4>VAT Invoice Automation <a href="https://efficientera.com/guide-vat/" target="_blank">(Read Documentation) </a> <a href="https://youtu.be/JsjAsQgSpwk" target="_blank"> (Watch Video)</a></h4>
            <p>If you sell in Europe and need to help your customers generate VAT invoices. Provide your VAT registration number and countries in which you are VAT registered.</p>


            <h4>Product Review Settings<a href="https://youtu.be/kYtOuRg5tf8?list=PLUYdN3DukWcJz0YGzj3QHLCjI7aIdPyiC" target="_blank"> (Watch Video)</a> </h4>
            <p>Access Product Review settings located in the right top area within the Product Review dashboard.
                Would you like to be notified each time you receive a review? Or would you like one daily digest email instead?
                By default, you will receive a weekly digest. For negative reviews set the star level below which you want to be notified.</p>
