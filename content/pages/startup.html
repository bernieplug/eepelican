        <h3>Welcome to Efficient Era!</h3>
        <p>We are excited to have you use our software. In order to derive maximum benefit from our ever growing set of tools, we have put together a recommended sequence of steps to follow. </p>


        <h4>1. Complete API Authorizations</h4>
        <ul class="fa-ul">
        <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-arrow-circle-right"></i>MWS</li>
        <p>Our software relies on MWS APIs to gather your data and send emails on your behalf. If you haven't activated your account yet, simply log into Efficient Era and follow the instructions for MWS authorization.</p>
        <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-arrow-circle-right"></i>Sponsored Products API</li>
        <p>Use your Login With Amazon credentials to enable our use of your Sponsored Products API for automating your PPC Campaigns. </p>
        <p>Note: In order to enable this API for multiple marketplaces ensure that your first log out of Seller Central from all marketplaces and then attempt
            to login with the marketplace you want Efficient Era to automate PPC Campaigns in.</p>
        </ul>

        <hr>
        <h4>2. Modify Product Details</h4>
        <ul class="fa-ul">
        <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-arrow-circle-right"></i>Adjust Product Titles</li>
        <p>Products are detected automatically by Efficent Era from Amazon. By default, the listing title on Amazon is the display name within Efficient Era.
            However, sometimes these titles can be fairly long when selecting them in dropdowns or settings.
            Feel free to edit these display names. These will only affect how your product is displayed within Efficient Era.
            In order to change display names, access Products from the <a href="https://app.efficientera.com/products/settings" target="_blank"></a> Products menu.
            You can also upload product details via csv by clicking on the Import/Export button at the top right are of your Products list.</p>
        <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-arrow-circle-right"></i>Enter Landed Costs</li>
        <p>The Landed Cost of a product is the cost to produce or procure each unit,
            along with any costs you incurred up until your product reaches an Amazon Fulfillment Center.
            If you are foulfilling a product via MFN, be sure to add the average cost of shipping from
            your warehouse.

            To set up Landed Costs visit Account Settings or go <a href="https://app.efficientera.com/settings/landedCost" target="_blank">here.</a>
            This information is required by us to correctly display your profit calculations on the Profits dashboard.</p>

        <p>Note: Since we auto-detect your products from Amazon, based on a listing report that we request,
            you might start noticing a new type of daily notification from Amazon letting you know that this report was requested. Since this alert can get noisy for some people, we recommend switching it off by going to Seller Central, access Notifications under your account name and then deselect

        </p>
        </ul>

        <hr>
        <h4>3. Set up Alerts</h4>

        Product Review Alerts and more to help you stay on top of your business. This is a list of alerts we support:</p>

        <h4>4. Create Follow-up Email Campaigns <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo-CeLkYqX4" target="_blank">(Watch Video)</a>
            <a href="https://efficientera.com/pages/email-templates/" target="_blank">
            (Read Documentation)</a></h4>


            <p>Emails are a great way to provide customer support and also request for reviews.
                Your email campaigns can be set to trigger each time a product was purchased, shipped or delivered.
                Define the layout and formatting of the email as you like. To enable and design Email Campaigns,
                access Email Automation settings within the Emails tool and make sure the follow-up email button
                is enabled. Also, choose the marketplaces you would like automation to be enabled for.
            </p>

        <p>In order for our Email automation system to start using Amazon's
            buyer-seller messaging system to send follow-up emails you need to add
            noreply@efficientera.com to the list of approved senders on Amazon. The steps are:</p>
           <ul class="fa-ul">
            <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-arrow-circle-right"></i>From Seller Central Settings select Messages in the top right area</li>
            <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-arrow-circle-right"></i>Select Authorized Emails</li>
            <br>
                <img src="/images/pages/authorizedSender.png" class="img-responsive" alt="Tools for Amazon Sellers" style="width: 30%;"></img>
                </br><li class=""><i class="fa-li fa fa-arrow-circle-right"></i>Add noreply@efficientera.com to the list of approved senders</li>
                    <br>

                <img src="/images/pages/noreply.png" class="img-responsive" alt="Seller Tools for Amazon Sellers" style="width: 30%;"></img>
            <br>
            <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-arrow-circle-right"></i>Test if Emails Are Sending</li>
            <p>To test if your Emails are getting sent out correctly from Efficient Era, access Amazon's outbox on Buyer-Seller messages
            <a href="https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/communication-manager/outbox.html" target="_blank">here</a>.
                <p>Note: Your emails will only get sent to Amazon once they hit an event trigger.
               For example, if your Email Trigger is set to <strong>Delivered + 2 Days</strong>
               then please check your Seller Central outbox when <strong>the first order that comes in <i>after</i> you signed up for Efficient Era</strong> is likely to
               get delivered + 2 days. Typically, this is 7-10 days from purchase.</p>
               <p>Also note: We currently do not have the ability to send emails for orders placed before you signed up for our service.</p>
            </p>
        </ul>
        <hr>
        <h4>5. Set up Bulk Order Alerts</h4>
        <p>While you are in the Email Automation settings (same as the previous step), you can specify how you would like to be notified each time there is a bulk order. Specify what you consider a bulk order. We have set it to default value of 10 but you can change this at any time. </p>

        <hr>
        <h4>6. Set up Return Reply Emails</h4>
        <p>
        Return Reply Email is a new feature that allows you to send an automatic email response
        to someone who has initiated a return. This is a good opportunity for you to take quick automated action,
        to ward off a negative feedback or better still, reverse their decision to return. Here are the steps to set it up:

        <ul class="fa-ul">

            <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-arrow-circle-right"></i>Auto-forward Return Emails</li>
            The email to auto-forward to, is
            mentioned in the right hand area of that page. In your case it is: R4N7J61Q8@refund.efficientera.com.

            In order for these emails to work, you will need to set an auto-forward rule in your email system (such as Gmail) where
                you receive return initiated notices from Amazon, to your unique returns auto-forwarding email at Efficent Era.
            This looks like <strong>Z4X7J30Q8@refund.efficientera.com</strong> and is located
            in the top right area of the <strong>Return Reply Emails</strong> sub-menu under <strong>Emails</strong>.
            As our system receives your auto-forwarded emails, we send out your returns reply email to the buyer.
            <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-arrow-circle-right"></i>Set Up Return Replt Templates</li>
            Next pick a Returns Reply template for your marketplace, and add content to it.
            Each marketplace has one template each. You can edit the contents of relevant templates and then enable them when you are ready.
        </ul>
​
        <p>Once you have completed these two steps, the replies for all your returns will be activated.</p>

        <p>Access Product Review settings located in the right top area within the Product Review dashboard.
            Would you like to be notified each time you receive a review? Or would you like one daily digest email instead?
