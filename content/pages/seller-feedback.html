       <p>Amazon’s measure of why a customer should buy from you, specifically, is seller rating. Your seller rating
           is the average rating you’ve received in all seller feedback, out of 5 stars.</p>

        <h3>Why Seller Feedback is So Important</h3>
        <p>Amazon’s guidelines state that your seller feedback should be over 95% positive, meaning less than 5% of your seller feedback should be neutral or negative. Note that Amazon considers a 3-star rating to be neutral, and anything below that counts as negative.
        If you’re below that 95% margin, expect your search rankings to quickly drop off the board. Of course, many top sellers on Amazon have 99–100% positive seller feedback, so in order to compete, you’ll need to be well above the cutoff.
        All that information is well and good, but when it comes down to it, what exact actions should you take when it comes to seller feedback?</p>

        Customers tend to leave seller feedback before they have a chance to post a product review. Also, a customer who took the time to leave negative seller
        feedback is more likely to post a product review, and it’s not likely they’ll have nice things to say there either.</p>


        <p>Despite this, when’s the last time you looked through seller feedback? The product rating is what’s displayed prominently on the page—not the seller rating. Why does seller feedback matter in the first place?
        For quite a few reasons, as it turns out. Customers may not care too much about your seller rating, but Amazon certainly does. More specifically, Amazon’s search algorithm cares.

        <h4>Automatic Positive Feedback Response Email</h4>
        </div>

        <p>What's unique about our Seller Feedback software is the ability to send out automated emails the moment you receive positive or negative Seller Feedback.
        When customers give you the thumbs up, show your appreciation. It’s a simple step, but an important one to thank them for their kind words.
        You can also suggest they contact you with any questions or eventual issues.
        This is an easy step towards building a relationship with your customers. You'll have a much better chance at creating a return customer, which has enormous value in the long run.
        Here's an example of what your Positive Feedback Email might look like.</p>

        <h4>Automatic Negative Feedback Response Email</h4>
        </div>

        <p>When it comes to a negative seller feedback, you have a limited window here—after you catch the negative seller feedback, but before they post a product review.
        If you can quickly and courteously reach out to them in this window, you may stop their negative opinion from becoming much more visible under your product reviews section.</p>

        <p>You don’t have to do much when you reach out. Be courteous, offer an apology, and try to help them resolve their frustration
        if you can. At worst, you’ll appear considerate and attentive. The fact that you cared enough to get in contact may stave
        them off from writing that bad review. At best, they may even edit or remove their seller feedback entirely.
        </p>

        <p>Efficient Era's Seller Feedback software automates this process for you so you don't lose any time. Here's an example of what your Negative Feedback Email might look like.</p>
