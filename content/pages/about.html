        <h3><i class="fa fa-book fa-lg"></i><span class="icon-label">Our Story</span></h3>
                <p>Our business originally started in 2009 as a private label seller on Amazon.
            As we grew, we realized we were spending far too much time on repetitive tasks.
            This led to us creating automated tools to help us become more efficient and profitable.
            As a result, we’ve gone from shipping out of the garage to shipping from warehouses around
            the world in the span of just a few years. In 2015, Efficient Era was born with the
            intent of providing our software tools to other Amazon sellers.</p>

        <h3><i class="fa fa-rocket fa-lg"></i><span class="icon-label">Our Platform</span></h3>
        <p>Efficient Era offers a range of tools for real-time notifications, actionable analytics
            and process automation for your private label business on Amazon. Selling on Amazon is awesome
            yet full of countless time sinks that encroach on your valuable time. Our software solutions
            help Amazon power sellers get a closer look at their day-to-day operations, leaving them with
            more time to focus on the big picture.</p>
        <p>Unlike a lot of tool companies that focus on a single aspect of automation, our goal at
            Efficient Era is to expand our ever growing set of offerings to cover more aspects of selling.
            Instead of scattering your energies on managing multiple tool vendors, Efficient Era offers an easy
            to navigate platform to manage all of your needs. In short, our goal is to help you become
            much more efficient and scale profitably.</p>
