E-commerce is changing retail as we know it. Just a decade ago, “small business owner” and “global seller” were mutually exclusive. With the explosion of e-commerce and especially the Amazon Marketplace, the world is a different place. Small business owners have been placed on equal footing with the previously undefeatable giant corporations.

In fact, small sellers have a lot of advantages over the bigger players in the commercial world. We can respond to market demands, customer needs, and the changing world around us with much more agility. In short, we're much more efficient.

The internet has enabled the opening of this new era of retail. The Efficient Era.</p>

<h3><i class="fa fa-briefcase fa-lg"></i><span class="icon-label">Our Story</span></h3>
<p>Our business originally started in 2009 as a private label seller on Amazon. As we grew, we were spending far too much time on repetitive tasks. This led to us creating a set of automated tools to help us become more efficient. As a result, we’ve gone from shipping out of the garage to shipping from warehouses around the world in the span of just a few years. In 2015 we started a team, Efficient Era, to focus solely on our software.</p>
