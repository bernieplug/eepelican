        <p>Here are some examples to help you visualize what your monthly charge might look like.
            Billing will be based on the peak number of ASINs and orders during the monthly billing cycle which,
            starts on the 1st of each month.</p>

        <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

        <h4>Q: Who is the intended audience of Efficient Era Tools?</h4>
        <p>Our software is targeted primarily towards Private Label Sellers using Fulfilment By Amazon (FBA) services. We offer a range of tools for real-time notifications, actionable analytics and process automation.</p>

        <h4>Q: What does “Buyer-Reviewer Matching” mean? How does that help me?</h4>
        <p>
        Efficient Era believes that contacting reviewers to address negative reviews is a hugely important part of running a successful Amazon business,
        and so we have developed extremely reliable buyer-reviewer software to help remedy this problem. Other companies have tried to offer solutions
        to this problem but their methods are often unreliable, either connecting the review to the incorrect buyer or not finding the buyer at all.
        Efficient Era’s software is much more consistent, allowing you to find the buyer associated with the review every time and reach out to address the problem.
        </p>

        <h4>Q: How will I be charged?</h4>
        <p>You will be required to set up Amazon Payments (one time setting). Once your account has been authorized, billing will
            happen automatically and you will be sent an invoice each month based on your usage.</p>

        <h4>Q: How often will I be billed?</h4>
        <p>You will be billed once every month. When your payment is due, we will send you an invoice
            with your usage and charge up to that point.
            </p>
<!--            If your 60-day trial ends in the middle of a month,#}
          we will combine the first month's payment with the following month.</p> -->

        <h4>Q: Do I need to provide you with credit card details during the free trial?</h4>
        <p>
            No, you will never need to provide us any credit card information during or after your trial period.
            We will require you to complete your setup of Amazon Payments when we send you the first notice of payment.
        </p>

        <h4>Q: What is Amazon Payments? Can I use Paypal or a credit card instead?</h4>
        <p>At this point, the only form of payment we accept is via Amazon Payments. It is a trusted service for both shoppers
            and merchants and you can read up more about it <a href="https://payments.amazon.com/shopper" target="_blank" style="color: darkorange">here</a>.
        </p>

        <h4>Q: How do you handle account cancellations?</h4>
        <p>Once you cancel your order we will remove your account from our system.
            You will need to manually disable permissions for Efficient Era from your Seller Central account.
        </p>

        <h4>Q: Can I trust Efficient Era with access to my seller account?</h4>
        <p>We, at Efficient Era take security very seriously. All passwords are encrypted using PBKDF2 algorithm with a SHA256 hash. Your Amazon credentials are encrypted with AES-GCM 256-bit encryption.
        Also, we use two-factor authentication to log into servers and services. All servers have firewalls, and we apply security updates regularly.</p>

        <h4>Q: I joined your service when it was part of a tiered pricing model. How does that affect me?</h4>
        <p>If you signed up with our previous tiered pricing model and received an email from us in October, you will be grandfathered into our old plan.
            For all other cases, you will be automatically added to our new plan. We do believe that our new plan would be more attractive to most people.
            Please let us know your preference.</p>

        <h4>Q: Q. Is there a way to reduce my monthly bill if I only use some of your products?</h4>
        <p>Although most of our popular features such as buyer-reviewer matching or seller feedback require order processing and manipulation, if your only purpose in using our service is to get review notifications and daily review digests, you could chose to use the review feature alone at the bare minimum charge, that is based on your number of products. The simple pricing calculation in this case is to multiply your ASINs by $0.08 to arrive at your monthly charge. (e.g. 200 ASINs x $0.08 = $16/month). Note that this is the only feature that does not require MWS or Seller Central access by our software (so make sure to disable them for Efficient Era). All of our other tools do require order processing, for which we incur infrastructural charges whether you use them or not, and you will get charges for your monthly orders at the rate of $0.01 per order.</p>


        <h4>Q. I don't use all your tools. Do you offer them individually?</h4>
        <p>In order to answer that question we would like to take a step back and share some of the philosophy behind the design of our tools and how they work in an integrated and holistic way. </p>
        <p>We believe that for buyers to become raving fans and repeat customers, their questions, concerns and complaints, however trivial, need to be addressed quickly and at every step of the purchase cycle, which starts with them clicking on a listing and continues on to after-care and support, even after the product was delivered. Being proactive at every step of their journey helps buyers have a positive experience with you as a brand, and this leads to them leaving good reviews in a natural, non-coercive sort of way. </p>
        <p>We're committed to creating tools and alerts for every step of the cycle, to help you mitigate negative reviews and encourage positive reviews. The cycles we talk of can be summarized into the diagrams below that we refer to as Feedback Loops (you can learn more about this philosophy <a href="http://buff.ly/2icRajk" target="_blank" style="color: darkorange">here</a>). Although our tools do not yet cover all aspects of these feedback loops completely, we are striving to make this our ultimate goal. This is the reason why we offer our entire toolset as a single unit, and at a single price point. We understand that it may not be feasible for you to adopt all of our tools because of feature preferences, but you are free to use only the ones that make sense to you.</p>

<h3> Here's what our customers are saying about us!</h3>
            <p>
            "We were looking for a service to help us match Amazon reviews with customer orders and came across Efficient Era.  I was instantly impressed with the intuitive layout of the dashboards and accessibility of information.  Once I added the products that I wanted to track I was blown away that close to 100% of our product reviews were linked back to a customer order!  This is by far the best service for matching customer review to Amazon orders - nothing else that we have used even comes close.  Add in all the other great features like product sales charts with price change and event indicators, downloadable large order reports, and more - this is an incredible tool for delivering actionable, accessible data to anyone who sells on Amazon." ~ Devin Kelly, <a href = "http://softy.com">www.softy.com</a></p>

            <p>
            "I love the large order email from Efficient Era.  I use this to keep an eye on my FBA inventory levels and also to help me see when I need to add a listing with larger quantities to give my customer a better value." ~ Kathy M.</p>

            <p>"I have fallen in love with this software much to my partner and childrens dismay ;-)" ~ Dr P Proctor MRCVS, SimplyPetsOnline Limited</p>
