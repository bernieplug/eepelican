                    Although most of our popular features such as buyer-reviewer matching or seller feedback require order processing and manipulation, if your only purpose in using our service is to get review notifications and daily review digests, you could chose to use the review feature alone at the bare minimum charge, that is based on your number of products. The simple pricing calculation in this case is to multiply your products by $0.08 to arrive at your monthly charge. (e.g. 200 products x $0.08 = $16/month). Note that this is the only feature that does not require MWS or Seller Central access by our software (so make sure to disable them for Efficient Era). All of our other tools do require order processing, for which we incur infrastructural charges whether you use them or not, and you will get charges for your monthly orders at the rate of $0.01 per order.

                    <br></br>
                      We believe that for buyers to become raving fans and repeat customers, their questions, concerns and complaints, however trivial, need to be addressed quickly and at every step of the purchase cycle, which starts with them clicking on a listing and continues on to after-care and support, even after the product was delivered. Being proactive at every step of their journey helps buyers have a positive experience with you as a brand, and this leads to them leaving good reviews in a natural, non-coercive sort of way.
                    <br></br>
                      We're committed to creating tools and alerts for every step of the cycle, to help you mitigate negative reviews and encourage positive reviews. The cycles we talk of can be summarized into the diagrams below that we refer to as Feedback Loops (you can learn more about this philosophy <a href="http://buff.ly/2icRajk" target="_blank" style="color: darkorange">here</a>). Although our tools do not yet cover all aspects of these feedback loops completely, we are striving to make this our ultimate goal. This is the reason why we offer our entire suite as a single unit, and at a single price point. We understand that it may not be feasible for you to adopt all of our tools because of feature preferences, but you are free to use only the ones that make sense to you.

            <h4>Q: Who is the intended audience of Efficient Era Tools?</h4>
            <p>Our software is targeted primarily towards Private Label Sellers using Fulfilment By Amazon (FBA) services. We offer a range of tools for alerts, actionable analytics and automation.</p>

            <h4>Q: What does “Buyer-Reviewer Matching” mean? How does that help me?</h4>
            <p>
            Efficient Era believes that contacting reviewers to address negative reviews is a hugely important part of running a successful Amazon business,
            and so we have developed extremely reliable buyer-reviewer software to help remedy this problem. Other companies have tried to offer solutions
            to this problem but their methods are often unreliable, either connecting the review to the incorrect buyer or not finding the buyer at all.
            Efficient Era’s software is much more consistent, allowing you to find the buyer associated with the review every time and reach out to address the problem.
            </p>

            <h4>Q: How will I be charged?</h4>
            <p>You will be required to set up Amazon Payments (one time setting). Once your account has been authorized, billing will
                happen automatically and you will be sent an invoice each month based on your usage.</p>

            <h4>Q: How often will I be billed?</h4>
            <p>You will be billed once every month. When your payment is due, we will send you an invoice
                with your usage and charge up to that point.
                </p>

            <h4>Q: Do I need to provide you with credit card details during the free trial?</h4>
            <p>
                No, you will never need to provide us any credit card information during or after your trial period.
                We will require you to complete your setup of Amazon Payments when we send you the first notice of payment.

            <h4>Q: I joined your service when it was part of a tiered pricing model. How does that affect me?</h4>
            <p>If you signed up with our previous tiered pricing model and received an email from us in October, you will be grandfathered into our old plan.
                For all other cases, you will be automatically added to our new plan. We do believe that our new plan would be more attractive to most people.
                Please let us know your preference.</p>

            <h4>Q: Q. Is there a way to reduce my monthly bill if I only use some of your products?</h4>

            <p>We believe that for buyers to become raving fans and repeat customers, their questions, concerns and complaints, however trivial, need to be addressed quickly and at every step of the purchase cycle, which starts with them clicking on a listing and continues on to after-care and support, even after the product was delivered. Being proactive at every step of their journey helps buyers have a positive experience with you as a brand, and this leads to them leaving good reviews in a natural, non-coercive sort of way. </p>
            <p>We're committed to creating tools and alerts for every step of the cycle, to help you mitigate negative reviews and encourage positive reviews. The cycles we talk of can be summarized into the diagrams below that we refer to as Feedback Loops (you can learn more about this philosophy <a href="http://buff.ly/2icRajk" target="_blank" style="color: darkorange">here</a>). Although our tools do not yet cover all aspects of these feedback loops completely, we are striving to make this our ultimate goal. This is the reason why we offer our entire toolset as a single unit, and at a single price point. We understand that it may not be feasible for you to adopt all of our tools because of feature preferences, but you are free to use only the ones that make sense to you.</p>

<h3> Here's what our customers are saying about us!</h3>
    <div class="well well-lg" style="background-color: dimgrey; color: white">
        <p>"We were looking for a service to help us match Amazon reviews with customer orders and came across Efficient Era.  I was instantly impressed with the intuitive layout of the dashboards and accessibility of information.  Once I added the products that I wanted to track I was blown away that close to 100% of our product reviews were linked back to a customer order!  This is by far the best service for matching customer review to Amazon orders - nothing else that we have used even comes close.  Add in all the other great features like product sales charts with price change and event indicators, downloadable large order reports, and more - this is an incredible tool for delivering actionable, accessible data to anyone who sells on Amazon." <strong style="color: darkorange">~ Devin Kelly, <a href = "http://softy.com">www.softy.com</a></strong></p>

    <div class="well well-lg" style="background-color: dimgrey; color: white">
       <p>"I love the large order email from Efficient Era.  I use this to keep an eye on my FBA inventory levels and also to help me see when I need to add a listing with larger quantities to give my customer a better value." <strong style="color: darkorange">~ Kathy M.</strong></p>

                Efficient Era saved one of my products! We had a product that had some sudden issues and got a string of a few negative reviews. We were losing sales and rank and were not sure if the product could be saved.
                Efficient Era was a lifesaver as it gave us the ability to match the review with the order information. It even could find the order information for reviews left as "Anonymous" or the frequent shopper "Amazon Customer". We were able to contact the customers who gave negative reviews and resolve issues that they had. Many of them who previously left a one or two-star rating changed their review to 5 stars and raved about our customer service!
                This helped us not only get the overall star rating back up but also identify product issues. We now use this product regularly to communicate with any buyers who left negative reviews. More often than not we are also able to get the star rating to improve. The software also has great alerts to monitor inventory levels, listing health, and hijacker detection. Efficient Era has saved me thousands in potential lost sales and has paid for itself over and over. <strong style="color: darkorange">~ Jonathan J.</strong>
