        <h4>Ad Report Types</h4>
        </div>

        <p>If you run Amazon Sponsored Products on a sizeable number of SKUs,
            you know that the sheer volume of data can be overwhelming. Our goal in providing you this tool
            is to help you navigate this data visually and at the same time provide you with insights
            that can help you make the right Ad spend decisions. In order to make use of this functionality
            you will need to enable Business Report - View & Edit permisssions in your Seller Central account.

            In this beta release of the Ad Reports tool, we provide the following different types of charts.

        <div class="page-header">
        <h4>Sales and Spending Chart</h4>
        </div>

        <p>The Sales and Spending Chart helps you track your Sponsored Product Ad sales and spending
            relative to your total Amazon Sales. This is very useful in learning how much of your sales come from
            advertising versus from organic reach. Ultimately, the goal of running sponsored ads
            is to influence the Amazon search engine to direct more traffic to your listings
            organically.</p>

        <div class="page-header">
        <h4>SKU Conversion to Session Percentage Chart</h4>
        </div>

        <p> This chart helps you track the conversion rate of your sponsored ads along with the conversion
            of your organic sales. Campaigns should always target to convert at the same rate or greater
            than organic sales. A high converting Ad campaign will have an impact on your keyword ranking
            for organic search also.</p>

            <p>Conversion Rate is the percentage of Clicks that become Sales.
            Why is this important and why should you track it? Arguably, the
            most important metric to make adjustments for, conversion Rate
            is a sign of ad campaign relevance
            and the quality of a listing in terms of bullet points, pictures,
            recent reviews, top reviews or description.</p>

        <h4>SKU Impressions to Unit Sales Chart</h4>

            rate (CTR) and conversions can help determine how relevant your campaigns are. This chart shows
            Targets can vary by category but are generally around 1k impressions to a sale.</p>
