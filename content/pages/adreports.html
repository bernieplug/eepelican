            You can quickly burn through your advertising dollars if you're bidding on the wrong keywords, attracting the wrong traffic or letting auto-campaigns run for too long.

            Efficient Era's new Ad Manager tool helps you create, modify and manage your sponsored product campaigns, act on our bid
            recommendations and match type change recommendations.
            With two-way synchronization with Amazon's Seller Central data, your optimization changes are almost instantaneous.

                        Ad Manager automatically pulls in your Campaigns, Ad Reports and Keywords data.
                        into a consolidated list to track your Impressions, Clicks and CTR. You can drill down to the ASIN
                        and marketplace level, by date range. You can also create new Auto and Manual campaigns. With the two-way synchronization
                        with Amazon, all changes are almost instantaneous.

                        Every week the Ads tool analyzes the effectiveness of your Amazon Pay Per Click Campaigns and suggests keyword bid recommendations that
                        you can act upon right away.
                        You can chose to accept, reject or delay bid recommendations, based on the relevance of keywords and your confidence level in them.
                        You can provide a per-product ACoS (Advertising Cost of Sale) target or go with our defaults.

                    Amazon Ad Reports and Search term reports give you a highly fragmented view of your advertising data.
                    In addition you need to keep downloading reports periodically. Efficient Era automatically requests
                    reports on your behalf and makes match type change recommendations so you are not wasting your Ad spend
                    by attracting the wrong traffic.

                       Your Search Terms reports can offer great insights about relevant keywords that users are actively searching for.
                        Harvesting these long-tailed keywords and adding them to your manual campaigns is an important part of a successful Amazon PPC strategy.
                        Ad Our Ads tool automates the process of new keyword discovery by digging through your impressions, clicks and sales data and finding the most relevant ones.

                                <br>Sellers often think of keywords as “Amazon SEO,” but it’s important to recognize critical differences from Google SEO. For starters, Amazon’s search engine is more simplistic. More importantly, it serves a different function, so a different approach is required to capitalize on it.
