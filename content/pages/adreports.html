        <p>Managing your Amazon Sponsored Products campaigns is hard.
            You can quickly burn through your advertising dollars if you're bidding on the wrong keywords, attracting the wrong traffic or letting auto-campaigns run for too long.

            recommendations and match type change recommendations.

                        Ad Manager automatically pulls in your Campaigns, Ad Reports and Keywords data.
                        into a consolidated list to track your Impressions, Clicks and CTR. You can drill down to the ASIN
                        and marketplace level, by date range. You can also create new Auto and Manual campaigns. With the two-way synchronization
                        with Amazon, all changes are almost instantaneous.

                    <p>

                        Every week the Ad Manager analyzes the effectiveness of your Ad Campaigns and suggest keyword bid recommendations that
                        you can act upon right away.
                        You can chose to accept, reject or delay bid recommendations, based on the relevance of keywords and your confidence level in them.
                        You can provide a per-product ACoS target or go with our defaults.

                    <p>
                    Amazon Ad Reports and Search term reports give you a highly fragmented view of your advertising data.
                    In addition you need to keep downloading reports periodically. Efficient Era automatically requests
                    reports on your behalf and makes match type change recommendations so you are not wasting your Ad spend
                    by attracting the wrong traffic.

                       How do you gauge the profitability of your Amazon Sponsored Products Ad campaigns?
                        How many impressions does it take to make an advertised SKU sell? How is your CTR?
