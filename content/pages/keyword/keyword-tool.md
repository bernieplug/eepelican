At this point, most online businesses know how important SEO is. It's not hard to understand why you need to rank well on search engines. What good is having a website if people can't find it? 

Equally important to internet sellers, but less commonly acted upon, is the need to optimize search ranking on Amazon. As online retailers continue to grow, more and more customers are making them their first choice for purchases. To be a successful Amazon seller, it's essential that users are able to find your product within the first few pages of the search results. But how?

Amazon provides some insight into how their search algorithm works and offers some guidance about the functionality of keyword fields, but the methodology of their search results is largely undocumented. Additionally, sellers have no access to data regarding their search ranking and no tools to help improve it.
