         <p>We all know that data is the key to success in many industries â€” Amazon selling is no exception.
           Amazon provides sellers with an overwhelming amount of data to sellers! Not all of it is easy to navigate or visualize.
           With Efficient Era, your data becomes more contextual and actionable than ever.

        <h3>Monitor Your Performance</h3>
        </div>

        <p>View general sales trends to get an idea of your overall success, or narrow down your focus to track how individual products are performing.
        Our dashboard gives you a convenient aggregated view of all your sales across all SKUs. You can chose to view your 7-day, 30-day or 90-day performance at a glance.
            What's more, if you are selling in the UK, you can see your performance in both Amazon.com
            as well as Amazon.co.uk in a single chart! From there you can narrow down to product specific sales charts. </p>

        <div class = "page-header">
        <h3>Contextualize Your Data With Events</h3>
        </div>

        Add customizable events to your charts to see your data in context and determine which shifts in sales or category ranking can be
        attributed to real-world happenings. Clicking on an annotated event on the sales chart highlights the event description in the right pane.
        From an internal keyword change to an encroaching competitor, never see an unexplained data shift again.</p>

        <p><img src="/images/pages/saleschart-event.png" class="img-thumbnail" alt="Amazon Sales Charts"></p>

        <p>Our tool automatically adds some events globally, such as when your product was renamed or when its price was changed. You could chose to turn off these automatic events.</p>

        <p>You could also chose to create and edit events based on your own descriptions. </p>
