<!--        <p class="Class2">
           Are you spending a ton of time trying to download Amazon reports,
           then opening them up in Excel and trying to make sense of them?
           By the time you have cleaned up one Excel document, it's time to download the next... A total time sink, with you playing catch up forever.

        You probably did not know about Data Warehouse, Efficient Era's giant data repository that will do all this for you, AND make your data searchable, sortable, exportable... by ASIN, by Date and by Marketplace.

        <p>What kind of data can we manage for you?
        At this point, we offer Review Changes, Reviews, Seller Feedback, Orders, Returns, Return Rates, Promotions, Promotion Count, Customers, Listings, Questions and Questions List.</p>


            <p>Overwhelmed with data scattered across Amazon reports, pages and listings?
            Want the ability to quickly search, sort, filter? Efficient Era's Data Warehouse is a giant
            repository of YOUR data gathered from multiple sources on Amazon, cleaned, normalized and
            organized at one single location. Easily export lists so you can slice-and-dice them for
        advanced analysis, offline retargeting or customer retention.</p>-->

                    <p>
        Amazon Business reports only give you a fragmented view of your data and
        you need to keep downloading reports constantly. Efficient Era can automatically request
        reports on your behalf and consolidate them into easy to navigate list views.

                    <li class=""><i class="fa-li fa fa-rocket" style="color: darkorange"></i><span style="color:#009999; font-weight: 600"><strong>Searchable Text</strong></span></li>
                    <p>
                    Search in text fields for patterns that can help you take action. For example, search your reviews for
                        words that repeat often and could get you in trouble. Word like "fake", "counterfiet", that Amazon's
                        bots are always on the lookout for.

                    <p>
                    We provide multiple filters on all our list views, so you can really zero in on the data you are after.
        For example, filter by marketplace, date range, ASIN and more. Once you are satisfied with your narrowed down results,
        you can export to csv.

                    </p>

                    <li  class=""><i class="fa-li fa fa-rocket" style="color: darkorange"></i><span style="color:#009999; font-weight: 600"><strong>Data Export</strong></span></li>
                    <p>
                       If you are not Excel savvy, our Data Warehouse gives you an easier way to create sorted
                        filtered data views.
                        Export your data at any time as csv files. Slice-and-dice your data for further analysis.
