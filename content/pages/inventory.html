       <h4>Avoid Stock-Outs</h4>
       <p>Don’t rely on Amazon’s often-late low-stock alerts — customize your alert settings so that you’re notified on an actionable time scale and react in time.</p>

       <h4>Act Upon Bulk Orders</h4>
       <p>Bulk orders are a sign of new relationships with businesses or very happy customers.
           Amazon doesn’t notify you about these by default — stay aware with our customizable
           notifications and take action to make these relationships flourish.</p>
