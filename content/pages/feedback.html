    <p>Reviews are a critical part of successful Amazon selling.
        Efficient Era gives you the tools to effectively process and respond to positive and negative reviews alike.
        Two key features of our review tool are the ability to precisely and accurately match reviews to orders from buyers, and the ability to get notifications via the dashboard or via email.</p>
    </p>


    <div class="page-header">
    <h4>Real-Time Notifications</h4>
    </div>
    <p>Efficient Era will keep you up-to-date via email each time you receive a new review.
        You could choose to send negative review notifications to a separate email address for more careful handling.
        Our email based review notifications come with embedded links to reviews and orders. Clicking on the review link (see image) takes you
        to the actual customer review page on Amazon. Clicking on the order link takes you straight to the order details page for that order.
        This then gives you the ability to send email to the buyer.

    <div class="page-header">
    <h4>Review Dashboard</h4>
    </div>

    <p>One of the great features of the Review Dashboard is that it gives you a bird's eye view of the reviews your product has received over a specified period of time.
        Multiple powerful charts let you assess your performance over time in terms of average rating and review velocity.

    <div class="page-header">
      <H4>Powerful Search Engine for Reviews</h4>
    </div>

        <p>Our powerful search engine lets you search your product reviews by any text or star ratings over a date range you specify.
    Access your data on a large scale, or on a product- or geography-specific basis.</p>

      <h4>Buyer-Reviewer Matching</h4>
    </div>
        <p>Replying to negative reviews has never been easier. Efficient Era automatically matches reviews to Amazon orders so you can address your customers’ problems.
        No guesswork based on names, either — we get verified data straight from Amazon.
        Each review shows you the orders that were placed by a buyer. Clicking on any order takes you straight to the Order Details for that customer.
        The image below shows how you can then connect to that specific buyer via Amazon's Buyer Seller Messaging Service. Never has buyer reviewer matching been so accurate
        and so easy!
