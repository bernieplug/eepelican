            reviews to buyers, after the changes Amazon made it their pages on October 26th, 2017.
            We are also aware that this is not likely to be a permanent solution.
            Amazonâ€™s recent changes to their web pages has convinced us that they could make changes to
            their pages and services at any time. While this might be a recurring theme, we are
            committed to evolving and finding ways to help you connect the dots and fill in the gaps

            to operate at maximum efficiency.

                            if you provide us with Seller Central credentials. But even in the absence of Seller Central credentials,
                            we can still match them with about 35% accuracy. All your reviews can be searched, filtered and exported.

                            You don't want to miss knowing when a review was posted. This is especially true of negative reviews.
                                Set up an alert with a rule to either send yourself a mail for each review or as a daily digest.
                                You can also set up alerts for multiple emails, even separate ones for positive and negative reviews.

                            If you are reaching out to buyers that leave negative reviews to help them resolve their issues
                                with your products, chances are they might change their rating or review text. You know that it would be
                                nearly impossible to keep track of these changes manually. Our Review Change List helps keep track of review changes automatically for you.
                                We also email you when someone changed their review.

                            There are two ways to look up your order matches. If we are able to match a review for you the order number shows up in the Review List.
                            If not, you can still trace them manually via the Orders List in our Data Warehouse.

                                While you won't need to see these every day, review charts are a useful analytical tool that provides visual cues
                                to gauge the overall health of your reviews. We provide charts showing aggregate and cumulative values of your reviews and ratings over time.
                                You can also see the breakdown of your reviews by geography.

                            <p>
                            While Seller Feedback is different from product reviews, a lot of buyers confuse the two and leave product
                                related feedback instead. Our seller feedback list is a searchable repository of all your seller feedback.
                                We are provide automatic seller feedback response automation for positive or negative ratings.

        <p>You know that Product Reviews are such a critical factor in growing a successful Amazon business.
            While positive reviews can really turn the flywheel in your favor, negative reviews can really
            hurt your sales. But when a buyer leaves you a one-star review, how do you contact them to find out what went wrong?
            Even if you wanted to reach out to them to make things right, you can't!</p>

            <p>Efficient Era's Buyer Reviewer matching tool
            <strong style="color: darkorange">accurately links product reviews from verified purchases to orders</strong>, and helps you contact
            buyers. Our email alerts contain direct links to the Amazon review page and to the Order Details
                page.</p>

            <p>Two key features of our Product Reviews tool are the ability to precisely and accurately
            match reviews to orders from buyers, and the ability to get alerts via email. We also now offer Historic Review Matching
                for orders placed before you joined Efficient Era.
            </p>


        <div class="page-header">
          <h4>Buyer-Reviewer Matching: How it Works</h4>
        </div>
        <p>Once you sign up for Efficient Era's <a href="https://app.efficientera.com/signup/" style="color:darkorange;">60-Day Free Trial</a>, we start matching your reviews to orders.
                    Our matching is not based on names, wish lists, addresses or guesswork.
                    It is a highly accurate matching process, but there are still some situations where we won't be able to match your
                    reviews. For example, when a review:
                    <ul>
                    <li>was not associated with a <strong><i>verified purchase</i></strong></li>
                    <li>was linked to an order that was not placed on <strong><i>your </i></strong>seller account.</li>
                    </ul>



                <p>Each review that is matched to an order is provided as a clickable link in our Review List, taking you
                directly to the Order Details page for that customer. </p>
                </p>

                </p>

                <br>
                <p>Once there, you can connect with the buyer via Amazon's Buyer-Seller Messaging Service to provide
                    great customer service and potentially turn the review around.

          <h4>Historic Review Matching : Digging Back Into the Past</h4>
        </div>
        <p>
        Efficient Era provides all its users with Buyer-Reviewer Matching - the ability to match reviews to
        buyers (orders), for no extra charge. This is available automatically for reviews you receive on orders placed starting
        from the date when you sign up for our services. But what about orders that were placed in the
        past? Up until this point, we did not offer the ability to go back in time to dig for buyer-review
        matches in the past. But now we do! Announcing the Historic Review Matching Tool, a new
        service that will search for all past orders and reviews and match them up.
        </p>
        <p>
        <strong>How much it costs</strong>: Historic Review Matching is a computationally heavy process that requires us to process your
        past orders, going all the way back in time and then match them to reviews. Historic Review
        Matching costs $1 per successfully matched review. This is available at the ASIN and
        marketplace level as an <strong>optional</strong> add-on to our existing services
        as an inn-app purchase.
        </p>
        <p>
        Our system will give you an estimate of cost before you begin the Historic Review Matching for
        the ASIN/marketplace combination. This is based on the number of reviews that we anticipate to
        be matched. The actual number of matches could be lower than this number, but not
        greater. As a result, the amount you pay could be lower but not greater than the
        estimated dollar value we show. This actual amount is not known till the process of matching
        is completed.
        </p>

        <p>
        <strong>How to get started</strong>: The Historic Review Matching tool can be accessed from the Product Review Dashboard.
        You can pick the ASIN to match, along with the marketplace. Our system will then give you an estimate of
        cost before you begin the Historic Review Matching for
        the ASIN/marketplace combination. This is based on the number of reviews that we anticipate to
        be matched. The actual number of matches could be lower than this number, but not
        greater. As a result, the amount you pay could be lower but not greater than the
        estimated dollar value we show. This actual amount is not known till the process of matching
        is completed.

                common problem. You can trace the cause by searching on some possible keywords.
                Like here, we filtered our Review List on 1 star reviews and typed the word "broke" in the review search bar. We found a large number of reviews with this complaint: "Broken on arrival". Perhaps its time to tell your supplier to improve their packaging!</p>
