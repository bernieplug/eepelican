    <p>Reviews are a critical part of successful Amazon selling. Efficient Era gives you the tools to effectively process and respond to positive and negative reviews alike.</p>
    <h4>Real-Time Notifications</h4>
    <p>Efficient Era will keep you up-to-date with an email every time you receive a new review. You can send negative reviews to a separate email address for more careful handling. Never miss a piece of feedback again.</p>
    <h4>Buyer-Reviewer Matching</h4>
    <p>Replying to negative reviews has never been easier. Efficient Era automatically matches reviews to Amazon orders so you can address your customers’ problems. No guesswork based on names, either — we get verified data straight from Amazon.</p>
    <H4>Powerful Review Data</h4>
    <p>From the Review Dashboard, view sort, and act upon all reviews, whether historical or new. Multiple powerful charts let you assess your performance over time in terms of average rating and review velocity. Access your data on a large scale, or on a product- or geography-specific basis.</p>
