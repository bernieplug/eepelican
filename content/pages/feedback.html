        <p>You know that Product Reviews are such a critical factor in growing a successful Amazon business.
            While positive reviews can really turn the flywheel in your favor, negative reviews can really
            hurt your sales. But when a buyer leaves you a one-star review, how do you contact them to find out what went wrong?
            Even if you wanted to reach out to them to make things right, you can't!</p>

            <p>Efficient Era's Buyer Reviewer matching tool
            <strong style="color: darkorange">accurately links product reviews from verified purchases to orders</strong>, and helps you contact
            buyers. Our email alerts contain direct links to the Amazon review page and to the Order Details
                page.</p>

            <p>Two key features of our Product Reviews tool are the ability to precisely and accurately
            match reviews to orders from buyers, and the ability to get alerts via email.

          <h4>Buyer-Reviewer Matching: How it Works</h4>
        </div>
        <p>Once you sign up for Efficient Era's <a href="https://app.efficientera.com/signup/" style="color:darkorange;">60-Day Free Trial</a>, we start matching your reviews to orders.
                    Our matching is not based on names, wish lists, addresses or guesswork.
                    It is a highly accurate matching process, but there are still some situations where we won't be able to match your
                    reviews. For example, when a review:
                    <ul>
                    <li>was not associated with a <strong><i>verified purchase</i></strong></li>
                    <li>was linked to an order that was not placed on <strong><i>your </i></strong>seller account.</li>
                    </ul>



                <p>Each review that is matched to an order is provided as a clickable link in our Review List, taking you
                directly to the Order Details page for that customer. </p>
                </p>

                </p>

                <br>
                <p>Once there, you can connect with the buyer via Amazon's Buyer-Seller Messaging Service to provide
                    customer <support></support>.

        <h4>Product Review Alerts</h4>
        </div>
        <p>Efficient Era will keep you up-to-date via email each time you receive a new review.
            You could choose to send negative review notifications to a separate email address
            for more careful handling. Our email based Product Review alerts come with embedded
            links to reviews and orders. Clicking on the review link (see image) takes you
            to the actual customer review page on Amazon. Clicking on the order link takes you
            straight to the order details page for that order. This then gives you the ability
            to send email to the buyer.

        <h4>Review Charts</h4>
        </div>

        <p>Review Charts give you a bird's eye view of the reviews your product has received over a specified period of time.
            Multiple powerful charts let you assess your performance over time in terms of average rating and review velocity.</p>

          <H4>Review List: A Powerful Search Engine for Review Data</h4>
        </div>

            <p>Our powerful search engine lets you search your product reviews by any text or star ratings over a date range you specify.
                Access your data on a large scale, or on a product- or geography-specific basis.</p>

            <p>Our Review List not only provides you with buyer-reviewer matches, it is also a very powerful search engine, in and of itself. Let's say you have a sneaking suspicion that most of your negative reviews lately are stemming from a common problem. You can trace the cause by searching on some possible keywords.
                Like here, we filtered our Review List on 1 star reviews and typed the word "broke" in the review search bar. We found a large number of reviews with this complaint: "Broken on arrival". Perhaps its time to tell your supplier to improve their packaging!</p>
