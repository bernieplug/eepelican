        <p class="Class2">Reviews and feedback are the most important social proof of your product. Amazon's ranking algorithm places heavy importance on the first 21 reviews received after product launch and beyond. With Feedback Manager, you can set up alerts to track your feedback and always be ready to support buyers by taking quick action. At any time, search all of your feedback and reviews and detect patterns for potential problems.</p>

        <!--
        <p>Reviews are, by far, the most important social proof of your product.
        When a buyer leaves a negative review, you want to quickly connect with them and help out.
        We provide accurate buyer-reviewer matching, including for anonymous 'Amazon Customers'.
        Our Review Matcher notifies you about reviews and feedback.
        At any time, you can search all of your reviews within the our Data Warehouse. </p>

        <p><strong style="color: darkorange">Update</strong>: Efficient Era's buyer-review matching is back!
            We can once again match your
            reviews to buyers, after the changes Amazon made it their pages on October 26th, 2017.
            We are also aware that this is not likely to be a permanent solution.
            Amazonâ€™s recent changes to their web pages has convinced us that they could make changes to
            their pages and services at any time. While this might be a recurring theme, we are
            committed to evolving and finding ways to help you connect the dots and fill in the gaps
            that Amazon leaves behind. We want our tools to make it easy for you as a seller,
            to operate at maximum efficiency.

            As a leader in the space of buyer-review matching, we are committed to continue bringing you
            the <strong><i>most reliable</i></strong> solutions for your review matching needs.

                            <p>We can accurately match your reviews to buyer IDs for verified purchases made from your seller account
                            if you provide us with Seller Central credentials. But even in the absence of Seller Central credentials,
                            we can still match them with about 35% accuracy. All your reviews can be searched, filtered and exported.

                            If you are doing the right things to help resolve customer issues, chances are they might change their rating or review text. You know that it would be
                                nearly impossible to keep track of these changes manually. Our Review Change List helps keep track of review changes automatically for you.

                            You don't want to miss knowing when a review was posted. This is especially true of negative reviews.
                                Set up an alert with a rule to either send yourself a mail for each review or as a daily digest.
                                You can also set up alerts for multiple emails, even separate ones for positive and negative reviews.

                            <p>
                            There are two ways to look up your order matches. If we are able to match a review for you the order number shows up in the Review List.
                            If not, you can still trace them manually via the Orders List in our Data Warehouse.

                                While you won't need to see these every day, review charts are a useful analytical tool that provides visual cues
                                to gauge the overall health of your reviews. We provide charts showing aggregate and cumulative values of your reviews and ratings over time.
                                You can also see the breakdown of your reviews by geography.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            While Seller Feedback is different from product reviews, a lot of buyers confuse the two and leave product
                                related feedback instead. Our seller feedback list is a searchable repository of all your seller feedback.
                                We also provide automatic seller feedback response automation for negative ratings.
