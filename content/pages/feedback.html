        <p class="Class2">Reviews and feedback are the most important social proof of your product. Amazon's ranking algorithm places heavy importance on the first 21 reviews received after product launch and beyond. With Feedback Manager, you can set up alerts to track your feedback and always be ready to support buyers by taking quick action. At any time, search all of your feedback and reviews and detect patterns for potential problems.</p>

                    <p>
                    You don't want to miss knowing when a review was posted. This is especially true of negative reviews.
                        Set up an alert with a rule to either send yourself a mail for each review or as a daily digest.
                        You can also set up alerts for multiple emails, even separate ones for positive and negative reviews.

                    <p>
                    There are two ways to look up your order matches. If we are able to match a review for you the order number shows up in the Review List.
                    If not, you can still trace them manually via the Orders List in our Data Warehouse.

                    <p>
                        While you won't need to see these every day, review charts are a useful analytical tool that provides visual cues
                        to gauge the overall health of your reviews. We provide charts showing aggregate and cumulative values of your reviews and ratings over time.
                        You can also see the breakdown of your reviews by geography.

                    <p>
                    While Seller Feedback is different from product reviews, a lot of buyers confuse the two and leave product
                        related feedback instead. Our seller feedback list is a searchable repository of all your seller feedback.
                        We also provide automatic seller feedback response automation for negative ratings.
