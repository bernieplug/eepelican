    <h2>Review Notifications</h2>
    <p>Review notifications work very simply: an automated service will send you an email every time you receive a product or seller review. For each review, the email will contain the star rating, the SKU of the item, the order ID, the date, the reviewerâ€™s screen name, links to the order and the review, and the text that the reviewer wrote.</p>
    <p>Thanks to the links, it is easy to respond to any reviews describing a problem. The service can just as easily be used to check on good reviews and note what your customers are pleased with. Harness all of the information you can get from reviews from the comfort of your inbox!</p>
