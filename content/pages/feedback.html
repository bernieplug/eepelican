        <p>Efficient Era gives you the tools to effectively process and respond to positive and negative reviews alike.
        Two key features of our review tool are the ability to precisely and accurately match reviews to orders from buyers, and the ability to get notifications via the dashboard or via email.</p>
        </p>

        <p>Unlike brick-and-mortar stores that do not
        give buyers an easy way of knowing what other customers thought of a product they see on the shelf, Amazon does.
        Product reviews are such a critical factor in growing a successful Amazon business. While negative reviews can
        really hurt sales, positive reviews can get the flywheel spinning in your favor.</p>

          <h4>Buyer-Reviewer Matching</h4>
        </div>
                <p>Responding to negative reviews has never been easier. Efficient Era automatically matches reviews to Amazon orders so you can reach out to your customers and address their problems quickly and effectively.
                There is no guesswork based on names, wish lists or approximate matches to external direct mailing databases.
                Each review associated with a verified purchase made on Amazon links you to the order. Clicking on any order takes you straight to the Order Details page for that customer.
                The image below shows how you can then connect to that specific buyer via Amazon's Buyer Seller Messaging Service. Never has buyer reviewer matching been so accurate
                and so easy!

        <div class="page-header">
        <h4>Real-Time Notifications</h4>
        </div>
        <p>Efficient Era will keep you up-to-date via email each time you receive a new review.
            You could choose to send negative review notifications to a separate email address for more careful handling.
            Our email based review notifications come with embedded links to reviews and orders. Clicking on the review link (see image) takes you
            to the actual customer review page on Amazon. Clicking on the order link takes you straight to the order details page for that order.
            This then gives you the ability to send email to the buyer.

        <h4>Review Dashboard</h4>
        </div>

        <p>One of the great features of the Review Dashboard is that it gives you a bird's eye view of the reviews your product has received over a specified period of time.
            Multiple powerful charts let you assess your performance over time in terms of average rating and review velocity.</p>

          <H4>Powerful Search Engine for Reviews</h4>
        </div>

            <p>Our powerful search engine lets you search your product reviews by any text or star ratings over a date range you specify.
            Access your data on a large scale, or on a product- or geography-specific basis.</p>
