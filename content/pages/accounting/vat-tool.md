Expanding your market overseas is a great step towards growing your business, but the ramifications can be daunting. Selling globally requires a lot of extra steps. One such step: value added tax (VAT).

Sending VAT invoices is necessary for any international sales to countries where a VAT is collected instead of a sales tax. Thankfully, we at Efficient Era have created a tool to ease the process of creating and sending VAT invoices to customers.

While European governments require VAT invoices for purchases through Amazon, Amazon does not provide any automatic tools to create or send these invoices. Without this tool, each invoice for overseas purchases would have to be manually sent with all the information gathered by hand. This is inefficient at best and completely unviable at worst.

What Efficient Era offers as a solution is a tool to complete this process automatically for each European sale.

The tool pulls data directly from Amazonâ€™s API based on the Amazon Order ID to automatically create the invoice using accurate data regarding the sale, including pricing, SKU, tax (of course) and all other important information. It will then send the invoice to the customer without any additional action required by the seller.

We hope this helps with your expansion to new markets!

#### Here's how the tool works:

1. Go the VAT Invoice Tool.
2. Fill in the correct information as it pertains to the sale.
3. Click the Submit VAT Invoice Request button.
4. The customer will receive an email containing a PDF of the VAT invoice.
