        <p style="color: dimgrey">Our program is free to join, easy to sign up and requires no special technical knowledge. We want to make it easy for you to talk about us! When you promote Efficient Era you get an instant benefit of 5 USD per user who completes their signup. But that is not all! You also receive a 100% of their first monthly payment to us!</p>

        <p style="color: dimgrey">When you join Efficient Era’s affiliate program, you will be provided an affiliate link you can use on your website or in your emails. When a user clicks on one of your links, they will be brought to our website and their activity will be tracked by our affiliate software program. Once they complete sign up, you will be credited $5 right away, and 100% of the seller’s first monthly payment to us once we confirm their payment.</p>
