        <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

        <h4>Which geographies does Efficient Era support?</h4>
        <p>At this point all of our tools are supported in the US (includes CA, MX) and UK (includes DE, IT, ES, FR). We also support Japan for our Review Tool, although this does not cover buyer-review matching.
        We will soon be able to provide full support of all of our tools in Japan. </p>

        <h4>Q: I sell in the US and the UK. Do I need to set up two Efficient Era accounts?</h4>
        <p>A; If you have two separate Amazon businesses, you are free to set up more than one account with us as long as
            your MWS and Seller Central accounts are unique for each of your accounts.
            The advantage of keeping a single account is that you can access all of your data in a single place.
        </p>


        <h4>Q: Do I have access to all your tools during the free trial?</h4>
        <p>A: Yes you do. We offer a substantially long trial period of 60 days which we think is required for reasonable amount of testing.</p>


        <h4>Q: Where can I find product tutorials/videos?</h4>
        <p>A; You can find product tutorial videos on our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/efficientera" target="_blank" style="color:darkorange">YouTube channel</a>.
            You could also refer to our other documents linked through our  <a href="https://efficientera.com/pages/startup/" target="_blank" style="color:darkorange">
            Startup kit</a>.</p>

        <h4>Q: What does “Buyer-Reviewer Matching” mean? How does that help me?</h4>
        <p>
        A: Efficient Era believes that contacting reviewers to address negative reviews is a hugely important part of running a successful Amazon business,
        and so we have developed extremely reliable buyer-reviewer software to help remedy this problem. Other companies have tried to offer solutions
        to this problem but their methods are often unreliable, either connecting the review to the incorrect buyer or not finding the buyer at all.
        Efficient Era’s software is much more consistent, allowing you to find the buyer associated with the review every time and reach out to address the problem.
        </p>

<!--        <h4>Can I have more than one account associated with a single merchant account?</h4>
        <p>Each Efficient Era account can have one US account and one UK account associated with it. You may have multiple Efficient Era accounts if you have multiple businesses. If you have more than one Amazon business, it is recommended that you create a single Efficient Era account for each so your all of your data and actionable items can easily be managed. </p>
        </br>
-->
        <h4>Q: Why does it look like my Sales Reports are not up to date?</h4>
        <p>A: Efficient Era utilizes data that is provided by Amazon which can have a 1-7 day delay. We provide this information to you as soon as it is readily available.</p>


        <h4>Q: How do I know my automated emails are being sent?</h4>
        <p>A; Emails are automatically sent based on the triggers you defined. These can be one of Confirmed, Shipped or Delivered. If your trigger is set to delivered, you should allow for
            a reasonable period of time for Amazon to completed the delivery. You can find the numbers of emails sent by looking at your Efficient Era dashboard under Order Automation at a glance.</p>

        <h4>Q: How do I automatically send VAT invoices with all my orders?</h4>
        <p>A: In order to automatically send VAT invoices with all of your orders; you must use the Efficient Era Order/Email Automation feature. You will find a button within the campaign you create to turn on the functionality to include a VAT invoice with every order.
        </p>


        <h4>Q: How do I delete my account?</h4>

            click on Request Account Deletion. You may also simply send an email to <a href="mailto:support@efficientera.com">mailto:support@efficientera.com</a> and request your account to be deleted.</p>
