Title: Large Order Notifications

Most Amazon sales consist of single purchases, but occasionally youâ€™ll receive large product orders. Besides being exciting, bulk orders can have important implications for your business. 

Receiving a large order could mean that your product is being universally adopted by another organization, or that someone loves your product so much that they want one for every extended family member. 

Whatever the case, a large order is a good sign that you have a very satisfied customer. 

In order to keep you up-to-date on these large orders, Efficient Era has developed a system that automatically sends you an email every time someone places a bulk order. Any order with more than 10 of the same item is the default setting, but this baseline is fully customizable.
