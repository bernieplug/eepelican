            </div>

            <div class="page-header">
                <h4>How does the program work?</h4>
                <p>Once your application is approved, we will send you your unique affiliate link, that you may share verbally or in written form,
                    share via email, place on your website or share in a suitable forum, such as a Facebook group, or other social media
                    channel.</p>
                <p>When a potential user clicks on the link, a cookie will be placed in their browser. This cookie contains your
                    affiliate identifier and will remain active for 30 days.
                    If, during this period, the user signs up for Efficient Era, their affiliation will be linked to you.
                    If, however, another affiliate shares their link with the potential user and they click on it,
                    your link will no longer be valid. </p>

                <p>If someone signs up with your affiliate link and continues on to becoming a paying subscriber to
                    Efficient Era, 50% of their first month’s charge will be paid to you.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="page-header">
                <h4>How much can I earn?</h4>
                <p>The referral fee equal to 50% of the FIRST monthly payment to Efficient Era made by a user who you referred via the affiliate link provided to you. We will not be able to make any payments unless the specific link that we provided to you was used to “register” for an account with us. If the user had already held an account with Efficient Era in the past, we will not be able to treat this as an affiliate referral. We will determine this based on the MWS credentials they used at the time of sign up.</p>

                </p>
                <p>Our pricing model scales proportionate to the size and volume of the business and monthly usage of our tools (i.e. number of ASINs and orders/month). This means that payment to our affiliates is directly proportional to the size of the user's business.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="page-header">
                <h4>What's the Payment Schedule?</h4>
                <p>EfficientEra.com will make payments in a timely manner via Paypal, within 15 calendar days of receiving correct and due payment from a user who signed up with your affiliate link. Please provide us your Paypal Merchant account at the time of application for the Affiliate program. You are responsible for informing us of any updates to your Paypal details and we will not be responsible for any delays that might occur as a result of these changes.</p>
                <p>Please note that Efficient Era has a 60-day free trial, so users will make their first payment as Efficient Era subscribers at the end of their third month of use.</p>

                <p>If a user you referred stopped using our services before the end of the free trial, no payment will be made to an affiliate.
                    Also, if the user used our services but did not make any payments, we will be unable to make ant payment to you.
                    No fraud will be tolerated.

                <p>We review each application before approval and we may re-evaluate your application at a later time.
