            <h3>Refer customers to Efficient Era and earn rewards!</h3>

            <h4>Who can apply to be an affiliate?</h4>
            <p>To qualify as an affiliate with Efficient Era you do NOT need to be an existing Efficient Era customer.  Once your affiliate application is received we will request you to provide your Social Security Number/Tax Identification Number if you are a resident of the United States. Once your application is approved, we will send you a link that you may share verbally, via email, place on your website or share in a suitable forum (such as a Facebook group, or other social media channel). If someone signs up with your link and continues one to be a paying subscriber to Efficient Era, 50% of their first month’s charge will be paid to you.</p>

            <h4>Benefits of Referral</h4>
            <p>Efficient Era is a fast growing SaaS company offering a wide range of tools for Amazon Sellers. Our major offerings include:
            Your One Stop Shop for: Buyer Reviewer Matching • Email Automation • Product Reviews • Seller Feedback • VAT Invoicing • Alerts • Inventory Health • Ad Analysis


            </p>
            <p>While most companies in this space offer individual tools, we offer all of our tools under for the same price.
                Our pricing model scales proportionate to the size and volume of the business and monthly usage of our tools (i.e. number of ASINs and orders/month).
                This means that payment to our affiliates is directly proportional to the size of the user's business.</p>

            <h4>How much can I earn?</h4>

        <p>The referral fee equal to 50% of the FIRST monthly payment to Efficient Era made by a user who you referred via the affiliate link provided to you. We will not be able to make any payments unless the specific link that we provided to you was used to “register” for an account with us. If the user had already held an account with Efficient Era in the past, we will not be able to treat this as an affiliate referral. We will determine this based on the MWS credentials they used at the time of sign up.</p>
            <p>Please note that Efficient Era has a 60-day free trial, so users will become paying customers in their third month of use. If they stop using our services before the end of the free trial, no payment will be made to an affiliate.

            <h4>Payment Schedule</h4>
            <p>EfficientEra.com will make payments via Paypal within 15 days of receiving payment from the user who signed up with your referral link. Please provide us your Paypal merchant account in at the time of application for the Affiliate program. You are responsible for informing us of any updates to your Paypal details and we will not be responsible for any delays that might result as a result of these changes.</p>
