                <h4>About Efficient Era</h4>
                <p>Efficient Era is a fast growing SaaS platform offering an ever-expanding range of software tools for Amazon Sellers.
                    We strive to be a one-stop shop for Amazon tools in the area of alerts, automation and analytics.
                    Our major offerings include:
                <ul>
                <li>Buyer Reviewer Matching</li>
                <li>Email Automation</li>
                <li>Product Reviews</li>
                <li>Seller Feedback</li>
                <li>VAT Invoicing</li>
                <li>Alerts & Notifications</li>
                <li>Inventory Health</li>
                <li>Ad Analysis</li>
                <li>Consolidated Dashboard Analytics</li>
                </ul>

                <p>While most companies in this space offer individual tools at separate price points,
                    we offer our entire tool set at the same price.
                    Our pricing model scales with the size of a business and monthly usage of our tools.
                    The larger the business your refer, the more you can earn as an affiliate.</p>

                <p>We also offer a relatively extended trial period of 60 days, so users can thoroughly test our tools before
                    they decide to become paid subscribers.</p>

                <p>Upon receiving your email we will evaluate your affiliate application and also request you to provide your Social Security Number/Tax Identification Number,

            </div>

            <div class="page-header">
                <h4>How does the program work?</h4>
                <p>Once your application is approved, we will send you your unique affiliate link, that you may share verbally or in written form,
                    share via email, place on your website or share in a suitable forum, such as a Facebook group, or other social media
                    channels.</p>
                <p>When a potential Efficient Era user clicks on your affiliate link, a cookie containing your unique identifier,
                    is placed in their browser. The cookie remains active for 30 days.
                    If, during this period, the user signs up for Efficient Era, their affiliation will be linked to you.
                    However, if another Efficient Era affiliate shares their link with the same user,
                    and they click on it, your link will no longer be valid. </p>

                <p>If a user signs up with your affiliate link and continues on to becoming a paying subscriber to
                    Efficient Era, 50% of their first month’s charge will be paid to you as commission.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="page-header">
                <h4>How much can I earn?</h4>
                <p>The referral fee equal to 50% of the FIRST monthly payment to Efficient Era made by a user who you referred via the affiliate link provided to you. We will not be able to make any payments unless the specific link that we provided to you was used to “register” for an account with us. If the user had already held an account with Efficient Era in the past, we will not be able to treat this as an affiliate referral. We will determine this based on the MWS credentials they used at the time of sign up.</p>

                </p>
                <p>Our pricing model scales proportionately with the size and volume of the business and monthly usage of our tools (i.e. number of ASINs and orders/month). This means that payments made to our affiliates is directly proportional to the size of the user's business.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="page-header">
                <h4>What's the Payment Schedule?</h4>
                <p>EfficientEra.com will make payments to you in a timely manner via Paypal, within 15 calendar days of receiving correct and complete payment from a user who signed up with your affiliate link.
                    Please provide us a valid Paypal Merchant account at the time of application for the Affiliate program. You are responsible for informing us of any updates to your Paypal details and we will not be accountable for any delays that might occur as a result of changes or incomplete informaion.</p>
                <p>Please note that Efficient Era has a 60-day free trial, so users will make their first payment as Efficient Era subscribers at the end of their third month of use.</p>

                <p>If a user you referred stopped using our services before the end of their free trial period, no payment will be made to you.
                    Also, if the user used our services beyond their free trial, but did not make any payments, we will be unable to make any payment to you.
                    No fraud will be tolerated.
            </div>

            <div class="page-header">
                <h4>Termination and Rejection</h4>
                <p>Either you or we may end this Affiliate Agreement AT ANY TIME, with or without reason, by giving the other party written notice. Written notice can be in the form of mail or email. In addition, this Agreement will terminate immediately upon any breach of this Agreement by you.</p>
                <p>We review each application before approval and we may re-evaluate your application at a later time.
                    We may also reject your application at our sole discretion or cancel your application if we determine that your partnership is unsuitable for our Affiliate Program.  We may consider your partnership unsuitable if you place our affiliate links in a location that:
