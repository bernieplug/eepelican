                <h4>About Efficient Era</h4>
                <p>Efficient Era is a fast growing SaaS platform offering an ever-expanding range of software tools for Amazon Sellers.
                    We strive to be a one-stop shop for Amazon tools in the area of alerts, automation and analytics.
                    Our major offerings include:
                <ul>
                <li>Buyer Reviewer Matching</li>
                <li>Email Automation</li>
                <li>Product Reviews</li>
                <li>Seller Feedback</li>
                <li>VAT Invoicing</li>
                <li>Alerts & Notifications</li>
                <li>Inventory Health</li>

                <li>Consolidated Dashboard Analytics</li>
                </ul>

                <p>While most companies in this space offer individual tools under separate pricing models,
                    we offer our entire tool set as a package for the same price.
                    Our pricing model scales with the size of a business and monthly usage of our tools.
                    The larger the business your refer, the more you can earn as an affiliate.</p>

                <p>We also offer a relatively extended trial period of 60 days, so users can thoroughly test our tools before
                    they decide to become paid subscribers.</p>

            <div class="page-header">
                <h4>How does the program work?</h4>
                <p>Once your application is approved, we will send you your unique affiliate link, that you may share verbally or in written form,
                    share via email, place on your website or share in a suitable forum, such as a Facebook group, or other social media
                    channels.</p>
                <p>When a potential Efficient Era user clicks on your affiliate link, a cookie containing your unique identifier,
                    is placed in their browser. The cookie remains active for 30 days.
                    If, during this period, the user signs up for Efficient Era, their affiliation will be linked to you.
                    Note: It is also possible that another Efficient Era affiliate partner shares their affiliate link
                    with the same person. If this happens we will count the last link that was used for signup
                    to determine the correct affiliation.
                    </p>

                <p>If a user signs up with your affiliate link and continues on to becoming a paying subscriber of
                    Efficient Era, 50% of their first monthâ€™s charge will be paid to you as commission.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="page-header">
                <h4>How much can I earn?</h4>
                <p>The referral fee equal to 50% of the FIRST monthly payment to Efficient Era made by a user who you referred via the affiliate link provided to you. We will not be able to make any payments unless the specific link that we provided to you was used to signup for an account with us. If the user had already held an account with Efficient Era in the past, we will not be able to treat this as an affiliate partner referral. We will determine this based on the MWS credentials they used at the time of sign up.</p>

                </p>
                <p>Our pricing model scales proportionately with the size and volume of the business and monthly usage of our tools (i.e. number of ASINs and orders/month). This means that payments made to our affiliates is directly proportional to the size of the user's business. Potentially his could be to the tune of thousands of dollars.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="page-header">
                <h4>What's the Payment Schedule?</h4>
                <p>Efficient Era will make payments to you in a timely manner via PayPal.
                    Once we have received the correct and complete payment authorization information
                    from a user who signed up with your affiliate
                    link, we will ask you to confirm your PayPal Account. If you are a US taxpayer, we may require
                    your Social Security Number or Tax Identification Number. If you are an international affiliate partner,
                    we do not require your taxpayer information.</p>


                    <p>We will evaluate your tax information and if all is good, we will pay you within 15 days of
                        receiving payment from the user. You are responsible for setting up your PayPal account correctly
                        and for informing us of any updates to it. Efficient Era will not be accountable for any delays
                        that might occur as a result of incorrect or incomplete information.
                        With every payment, PayPal transaction fees might apply.
                        Please refer to PayPal's policies for transaction fees for each country.</p>

                    <p>Please note that Efficient Era has a 60-day free trial, so users will make their first payment as Efficient Era subscribers at the end of their third month of use.</p>

                <p>If a user you referred stopped using our services before the end of their free trial period, no payment will be made to you.
                    Also, if the user used our services beyond their free trial, but did not make any payments, we will be unable to make any payment to you.
                    No fraud will be tolerated.

Written notice can be in the form of email. In addition, this Agreement will terminate immediately upon any breach of this Agreement by you.</p>
                <p>We review each application before approval and we may re-evaluate your application at a later time.
