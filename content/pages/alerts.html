        <p>As a business owner, you know you need to keep track of every event that could potentially threaten the health of your business.
        How does one stay on top of everything that really matters? To make things complicated, Amazon doesn’t
        tell you about important changes and trends with your products. That's why we are
        constantly adding new alerts and notifications so you can set the rules and let the software do the watching and informing.</p>
        <p>Here is a list of our current and upcoming notification types</p>
           <ul class="fa-ul">
                    <li class=""><i class="fa-li fa fa-check-square"></i>Product Review Notifications</li>
                    <li class=""><i class="fa-li fa fa-check-square"></i>Seller Feedback Notifications</li>

        <div class="page-header">
          <h4>Product Review Notifications</h4>
        </div>
        <p>Efficient Era will keep you up-to-date via email each time you receive a new review. You could choose to send negative review
            notifications to a separate email address for more careful handling. Our email based review notifications come with embedded
            links to reviews and orders. Clicking on the review link takes you to the actual customer review page on Amazon.
            Clicking on the order link takes you straight to the order details page for that order. This then gives you the ability to
            send email to the buyer.</p>

        <div class="page-header">
          <h4>Seller Feedback Notifications</h4>
        </div>
        <p>With Efficient Era's Seller Feedback Alerts, you get notified of Seller Feedback instantly to your email. You can also chose to
            receive a daily digest that summarizes all the feedback you received during the day. In addition, our dashboard makes
            it possible to see how you are doing over time.
        </p>


        <div class="page-header">
          <h4>Bulk Order Notification</h4>
        </div>
        <p>Most Amazon sales consist of single purchases, but occasionally you’ll receive large product orders.
        Besides being exciting, bulk orders can have important implications for your business.
        Receiving a large order could mean that your product is being universally adopted by another
        organization, or that someone loves your product so much that they want one for every extended
        family member. Whatever the case, a large order is a good sign that you have a very satisfied customer.
        In order to keep you up-to-date on these large orders, Efficient Era sends you notifications
        every time someone places a bulk order. What's more, you can define what you consider a bulk order.
        By default, this number is set to 10 items.</p>
