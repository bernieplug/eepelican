                      <p class="Class2" style="padding: 10px">
                         Are you aware that other sellers who have a contribution score higher that yours could change parts of your listing? Also do you know that Amazon Warehouse or Amazon Retail have the highest contribution score, even if you are the brand registered owner. We send you SKU change alerts whenever something about your SKU has changed. If you know it was you who initiated a change you have no cause for concern.</p>
                                               <p class="Class2" style="padding: 10px">Our Alerts contain a table of changes.
                                                   The terms Seller SKU, Mfr Part Number and Model Number are often used interchangeably within Amazon’s listing. Not all ASINs have the same layout for listing detail pages, so these attributes may not be visible to you. However, we have detected that these have been changed in Amazon’s database – they could have been initiated you, Amazon themselves, or a hijacker.</p>

                      <h4 class="Class2" style="padding: 10px">How can you tell what changed?</h4>

                      <p class="Class2" style="padding: 10px">Check the ‘Vital Info’ and ‘Offer’ tabs of your listing to confirm any changes you might have made. If your contributions for these fields doesn't match the current Amazon values, someone else may be overriding your listing. If you are not brand registered for this product, it may be another seller. If you are brand registered, Amazon internal teams may still override your contributions to the listing. Check if new values match the SKU of any competitors, check for new sellers who might be hijacking your listing, and be on the lookout for further listing changes. If you're brand registered, contact Amazon Seller Support and report the incorrect change to your product, with proof that this is one of your brand registered products, and the correct values you would like Amazon to restore.</p>

                      <p class="Class2" style="padding: 10px">You know that organic search results and keyword relevancy depend heavily on the words that you use in your Product Title. Unfortunately, Amazon makes it fairly easy for other sellers to change these in ways that can hurt your organic and paid search ranking. </p>

                      <p class="Class2" style="padding: 10px">If you've received this type of alert from us, check that the change was not intentional. Open a ticket with Amazon support if you are brand owner and think it may be an Amazon team like Amazon Warehouse or Amazon Retail that made the change. They always have a higher listing contribution score.</p>

                      <p class="Class2" style="padding: 10px">Amazon is known to constantly evolve categories and sub-categories as they see the need to group items based on customers' buying behavior.</p>

                    <p class="Class2" style="padding: 10px">While a category change might seem harmless by itself it cab actually impact a lot of things such as your Amazon Fees. It can also impact your overall ranking in a new category your product might be placed under. </p>

                    <h4 class="Class2" style="padding: 10px">What should you do when a category changes?</h4>

                    <p class="Class2" style="padding: 10px">Be aware that your Amazon fees could increase. Also if you have access to an Amazon Account Manager, offer an explanation for why you think your products fit better in the category you think it belongs to.</p>
