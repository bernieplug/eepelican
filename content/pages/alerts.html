        <p>As a business owner, you know you need to keep track of every event that could potentially threaten the health of your business.
        How does one stay on top of everything that really matters? To make things complicated, Amazon doesn’t
        tell you about important changes and trends with your products. That's why we are
        constantly adding new alerts so you can set the rules and let the software do the watching and informing.</p>
        <p>Here is a list of our current and upcoming alert types</p>
           <ul class="fa-ul">

          <h4>Listing Hijack Alerts</h4>
        </div>

        <p>Does the fear of listing hijackers keep you up at night? Since Amazon allows multiple sellers to sell their products on a single ASIN, it’s easy and legal for a competitor or hijacker to replace any of your beautifully crafted listing details with shoddy images, poor titles, sub-standard descriptions or worse, incorrect product details.
            What’s more, your “listing hijacker” could be Amazon Warehouse deals or Amazon Retail themselves. We have heard uncountable stories of brand registered, Private Label Sellers being kicked out of their own listings by Amazon Retail or Warehouse Deals, both of which have a higher contribution score to affect listing overrides. Being stuck with the unnecessary chore of submitting endless change request tickets to a largely ineffective Seller Support ticketing system can be your worst nightmare.</p>
        <p>Efficient Era’s Listing Hijack Alerts were born out of the need to help sellers quickly become aware of overrides and hijacks of key fields. Our alerts do a much better job than the ASIN Change Notification emails you might receive from Amazon, because we:
        include the fields that changed and their old and new values (to better understand what's different)
        send one email per ASIN, so emails can be routed to a ticket system to track dealing with each one
        cover more fields and ASIN characteristics (e.g. variations, brand, etc) and more reliably.</p>
                   <ul class="fa-ul">
                       <li class=""><i class="fa-li fa fa-check-square"></i>Condition change</li>
                       <li class=""><i class="fa-li fa fa-check-square"></i>Other FBA sellers</li>
                       <li class=""><i class="fa-li fa fa-check-square"></i>Variation Change</li>
                       <li class=""><i class="fa-li fa fa-check-square"></i>Title change</li>
                       <li class=""><i class="fa-li fa fa-check-square"></i>Feature Bullet change</li>
                       <li class=""><i class="fa-li fa fa-check-square"></i>Brand change</li>
                       <li class=""><i class="fa-li fa fa-check-square"></i>SKU change</li>
                       <li class=""><i class="fa-li fa fa-check-square"></i>Top-Level Category Change</li>

          <h4>Bulk Order Alerts</h4>
        </div>
        <p>Most Amazon sales consist of single purchases, but occasionally you’ll receive large product orders.
        Besides being exciting, bulk orders can have important implications for your business.
        Receiving a large order could mean that your product is being universally adopted by another
        organization, or that someone loves your product so much that they want one for every extended
        family member. Whatever the case, a large order is a good sign that you have a very satisfied customer.
        In order to keep you up-to-date on these large orders, Efficient Era sends you notifications
        every time someone places a bulk order. What's more, you can define what you consider a bulk order.
        By default, this number is set to 10 items.</p>

        <div class="page-header">
          <h4>Product Review Alerts</h4>
        </div>
        <p>Efficient Era will keep you up-to-date via email each time you receive a new review. You could choose to send negative review
            notifications to a separate email address for more careful handling. Our email based review notifications come with embedded
            links to reviews and orders. Clicking on the review link takes you to the actual customer review page on Amazon.
            Clicking on the order link takes you straight to the order details page for that order. This then gives you the ability to
            send email to the buyer.</p>

        <div class="page-header">
          <h4>Seller Feedback Alerts</h4>
        </div>
        <p>With Efficient Era's Seller Feedback Alerts, you get notified of Seller Feedback instantly to your email. You can also chose to
            receive a daily digest that summarizes all the feedback you received during the day. In addition, our dashboard makes
            it possible to see how you are doing over time.
