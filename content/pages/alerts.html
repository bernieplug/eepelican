                      <p class="Class2" style="padding: 10px">The terms Seller SKU, Mfr Part Number and Model Number are often used interchangeably within Amazon’s listing. Not all ASINs have the same layout for listing detail pages, so these attributes may not be visible to you. However, we have detected that these have been changed in Amazon’s database – they could have been initiated you, Amazon themselves, or a hijacker.</p>

                      <p class="Class2" style="padding: 10px">OUR RECOMMENDATION</p>
                      <p class="Class2" style="padding: 10px">Check the ‘Vital Info’ and ‘Offer’ tabs of your listing to confirm any changes you might have made. If your contributions for these fields doesn't match the current Amazon values, someone else may be overriding your listing. If you are not brand registered for this product, it may be another seller. If you are brand registered, Amazon internal teams may still override your contributions to the listing. Check if new values match the SKU of any competitors, check for new sellers who might be hijacking your listing, and be on the lookout for further listing changes. If you're brand registered, contact Amazon Seller Support and report the incorrect change to your product, with proof that this is one of your brand registered products, and the correct values you would like Amazon to restore.</p>
