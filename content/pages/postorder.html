    <p>In the e-commerce world, sending follow-up emails is a fairly standard practice. As the name suggests, follow-up emails are sent
    after a customer places an order. On Amazon however, follow-up emails work a bit differently from the seller's perspective.
    That’s because Amazon already sends out order notifications at every stage of shipping. What’s left for sellers to do? Quite a bit, as it turns out.

    </p>

    <div class="page-header">
    <h4>What Should Your Follow-Up Emails Contain?</h4>
    </div>
    As you know, Amazon automatically notifies all customers when their orders are confirmed, shipped, and delivered by default.
    Sellers aren’t responsible for providing their customers this information, so what kinds of things should you send in your follow-up emails?

    <h5>1. A Thank-You</h5>

    <p>It might seem obvious, but a simple “Thank you for buying our product!” can work wonders when it comes to personifying your brand.
        Brand recognition and retention are very difficult tasks for third-party sellers on Amazon, since most Amazon shoppers are only
        thinking about the brand that’s being constantly pushed into their face: Amazon. By thanking the customer, you instantly convey
        the uniqueness of your brand. It’s as much as 10 times easier to sell to a returning customer than to a new one.
        A thank-you is one more step towards convincing that customer to return.
    </p>

    <h5>2. Any Out-of-Box Needs</h5>

    <p>While some products are fairly self-explanatory to use, some may require explanation. Ideally you want your customer
        to be able to use their product with ease the moment they take it out of the box.
        The most common example would be a user manual, sent as an attachment. If you’re selling electronics,
        specifically peripherals, you can also include links to drivers that need to be installed prior to use,
        so that the device can work as soon as they plug it in. Include whatever materials a customer needs to
        have the best out-of-box experience possible.</p>

    <h5>3. A Link to Leave a Review</h5>

    <p>One of the most beneficial ways to use follow-up emails is to ask the customer to leave a review if they’re satisfied.
        To make it even more convenient include a link that takes them straight to the ‘Leave a Product Review’ page for the
        product they bought — no one wants to click all over Amazon’s website just to be able to write a review.

        As an addition to this request, you can (and should) ask customers to contact you directly if they experience
        any problems with the product. Using follow-up emails in this way carries significant benefits, but you’ll need
        to act with some finesse in order to get it right. </p>

    <h4>Customize your Email Themes</h4>
    </div>

       <p>Efficient Era offers takes advantage of Amazon's Buyer Seller Messaging System to send out follow-up. Our email themes are completely customizable.
           You could choose between plain text format, simple layout
           or customize the HTML templates as you like. At a theme level, you can specify the text and images that automatically get attached to the
           headers and footers of every single product listing. For example, you might want to add company specific signatures or logos.
           Themes can be created separately for each geography in multiple languages to serve multiple geographies.</p>
           <p>We provide you another layer of flexibility through Text Placeholders (see image below). Weave in text placeholders into your
               message to allow for dynamic and automated replacement text on the fly.</p>

    <div class="page-header">
    <h4>Create Emails Campaigns with Event Triggers</h4>
    </div>

    <p> With Efficient Era's Email Automation, you can send more than one follow-up email based on certain triggers that you can define within an
        "Email Campaign". Keep the customer updated at every step of the way. For example, send a thank you note when their product ships; offer support
        when their product arrives; check up a few days later, once they’ve tried the product out, and ask for a review.
        Just remember not to overdo it! We recommend no more than 2 emails per order.</p>

    <div class="page-header">
    <h4>Flexible Campaigns at the Product Level</h4>
    </div>

        <p>Our powerful Email Automation tool allows you to attach a single theme to multiple Email Campaigns. Each Email Campaign could in turn be
        associated with multiple products, providing you ultimate flexibility in defining how you connect with customers at the product level.</p>
        <p><img src="/images/pages/Email Themes.png" class="img-thumbnail"></p>
        <p>What's more, campaigns can be enabled or disabled for specific marketplaces. This gives you the flexibility of treating marketplaces based sales differently.
            If a product is sold in two different marketplaces, for example, and you would like to send emails that are in those specific languages,
            create two separate campaigns associated with the product, one in each language. When our system detects a sale made in
        a marketplace, it will generate the correct email for that marketplace in that language.</p>
        <p>The image below shows the relationship between a Theme, Campaign, Products and Marketplaces.

   campaigns allows you to send email messages to customers once the order is placed, the product is shipped or when the
           product is delivered.</p>

        <p>Use our default themes for follow-up emails, or create your own. Add different themes for different geographies
        if you want to add native-language translations for your international customers.</p>
