    <h2>Post Order Emails</h2>
    <p>Post-order emails are a great way to grow your business, but they need to be automated to be able to realistically send them out. Efficient Era offers completely automated post-order emails so that you can keep the conversations with your customers going. Our customizable HTML templates and event-triggered post-order system is coming soon! </p>
    <h4>Provide Support Before They Need It</h4>
    <p>Post-order emails are a great place to solve your customers’ problems before they even know they have them. Attach product manuals, provide special instructions, and provide links to drivers to ensure frustration-free unboxing experiences.</p>
    <h4>Customize your Templates</h4>
    <p>Use our default templates for post-order emails, or create your own. Add different templates for different geographies if you want to add native-language translations for your international customers.</p>
    <h4>Trigger Multiple Emails with Events</h4>
    <p>Don’t settle for one post-order email — keep the customer updated every step of the way. Send a manual when their product ships; offer support when their product arrives; check up a few days later, once they’ve tried the product out, and ask for a review.</p>
