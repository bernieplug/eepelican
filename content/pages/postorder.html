                    <p>
                    Email Automator comes with pre-populated post-order email templates that you can modify and customize based on your requirements.
                    Our placeholders make it easy for you to personalize your message for each order, for example, by addressing the customer by their full name or
                    referring to their order number, without having to manually reference it.

                    <p>
                    Inserting images is easy with Email Automator's formatting tool. We support standard image formats.
                        You can also insert PDFs (within Amazon Terms of Service).
                        Create a global collection of PDFs that you can use across multiple campaigns.
                        Attach upto 10 attachments per email campaign.

                    <p>
                    We provide 3 types of events trigger for your email campaigns, based on when an order is confirmed, shipped or delivered.
                        While the Confirmed and Shipped triggers are based on real time Amazon data,
                        Delivered is an estimate on historical arrival times.

                    <p>
                        One of the reasons why a lot of sellers use email auto-responders is to request for reviews. We make it easy
                        by providing you with predefined links to request for Product Reviews, Seller Feedback, General Review and more.
                        Politely asking for an honest review is not a violation of Amazon Terms of Service.

                    <p>
                    Thanks to Amazon's opt-out settings for buyers, not all emails are delivered. Of those that are delivered, not all are opened.
                        Your Email Open Rate is an important metric to know how eye-catching your subject line is and how engaged your buyers are.
                        Now you can see your sent and open rates on a time series chart.

                    <p>
                    Buyers that unsubscribe from your email messaging are automatically added to our Blacklist. In addition, you can also manually blacklist
                        marketplace addresses. You can also set auto forwarding for your opt-out messages to be included in the blacklist.

    <p>With Efficient Era's Email Automation system, you can set up Follow-Up Email
        Campaigns that get triggered based on events
        such when an order was placed, shipped or delivered, including any delays you specify. Weave
        placeholders into your message to dynamically address the buyer by name, refer to the product
        they bought and even add a link to the product review page. Format with our rich text editor
        or modify the HTML code.</p>

    <div class="page-header">
    <h4>Customizable Email Themes</h4>
    </div>

       <p>Efficient Era offers takes advantage of Amazon's Buyer Seller Messaging System to send out follow-up emails. Our email themes are completely customizable.
           You could choose between plain text format, simple layout
           or customize the HTML templates as you like. If you are a beginner we recommend picking a pre-created theme which is attached to a campaign by default.

           If you are designing your own themes use the Theme Designer to specify the text and images that automatically get added to the
           headers and footers of a campaign. For example, you might want to add company specific signatures or logos.
           Themes can be created separately for each geography in multiple languages to serve multiple geographies.</p>
           <p>We provide you another layer of flexibility through Text Placeholders (see image below). Weave in text placeholders into your
               message to allow for dynamic and automated replacement text on the fly.</p>

    <div class="page-header">
    <h4>Create Emails Campaigns with Event Triggers</h4>
    </div>

    <p> With Efficient Era's Email Automation, you can send more than one follow-up email based on certain triggers that you can define within an
        "Email Campaign". Keep the customer updated at every step of the way. For example, send a thank you note when their product ships; offer support
        when their product arrives; check up a few days later, once they’ve tried the product out, and ask for a review.
        Just remember not to overdo it! We recommend no more than 2 emails per order.</p>

        <img src="/images/pages/event_triggers.png" class="img-thumbnail" alt="Amazon Email Automation">
            <p></p>

    <div class="page-header">
    <h4>Flexible Campaigns at the Product Level</h4>
    </div>

        <p>Our powerful Email Automation tool allows you to attach a single theme to multiple Email Campaigns. Each Email Campaign could in turn be
        associated with multiple products, providing you ultimate flexibility in defining how you connect with customers at the product level.</p>
        <p><img src="/images/pages/Email Themes.png" class="img-thumbnail"></p>
        <p>What's more, campaigns can be enabled or disabled for specific marketplaces. This gives you the flexibility of treating marketplaces based sales differently.
            If a product is sold in two different marketplaces, for example, and you would like to send emails that are in those specific languages,
            create two separate campaigns associated with the product, one in each language. When our system detects a sale made in
        a marketplace, it will generate the correct email for that marketplace in that language.</p>
        <p>The image below shows the relationship between a Theme, Campaign, Products and Marketplaces.

        <div class="page-header">
    <h4>What Should Your Follow-Up Emails Contain?</h4>
    </div>

    <p>In the e-commerce world, sending follow-up emails is a fairly standard practice. As the name suggests, follow-up emails are sent
    after a customer places an order. On Amazon however, follow-up emails work a bit differently from the seller's perspective.
    That’s because Amazon already sends out order notifications at every stage of shipping. What’s left for sellers to do? Quite a bit, as it turns out.

    </p>

    <h5>1. A Thank-You</h5>

    <p>It might seem obvious, but a simple “Thank you for buying our product!” can work wonders when it comes to personifying your brand.
        Brand recognition and retention are very difficult tasks for third-party sellers on Amazon, since most Amazon shoppers are only
        thinking about the brand that’s being constantly pushed into their face: Amazon. By thanking the customer, you instantly convey
        the uniqueness of your brand. It’s as much as 10 times easier to sell to a returning customer than to a new one.
        A thank-you is one more step towards convincing that customer to return.
    </p>

    <h5>2. Any Out-of-Box Needs</h5>

    <p>While some products are fairly self-explanatory to use, some may require explanation. Ideally you want your customer
        to be able to use their product with ease the moment they take it out of the box.
        The most common example would be a user manual, sent as an attachment. If you’re selling electronics,
        specifically peripherals, you can also include links to drivers that need to be installed prior to use,
        so that the device can work as soon as they plug it in. Include whatever materials a customer needs to
        have the best out-of-box experience possible.</p>

    <h5>3. A Link to Leave a Review</h5>

    <p>One of the most beneficial ways to use follow-up emails is to ask the customer to leave a review if they’re satisfied.
        To make it even more convenient include a link that takes them straight to the ‘Leave a Product Review’ page for the
        product they bought — no one wants to click all over Amazon’s website just to be able to write a review.

        As an addition to this request, you can (and should) ask customers to contact you directly if they experience
        any problems with the product. Using follow-up emails in this way carries significant benefits, but you’ll need
        to act with some finesse in order to get it right. </p>

    <p> While most email automation tools, including ours, give you the flexibility to send
        multiple emails to the same buyer on a single order, we highly recommend that you use this feature
        with discretion since the annoyance factor can actually have a detrimental effect.
