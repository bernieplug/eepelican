Title: Review Notifications
save_as: pages/feedback/review-notifications.html

One of the things that can most clearly make or break a branded Amazon seller is the customer rating of your products. Nowadays, people don’t buy something without first checking the reviews. Positive reviews are a sure sign you’re doing something right, and they indicate this to other interested buyers. Even more important, however, are the daunting negative reviews.

Sellers live in fear of the day that the inevitable one-star review shows up, accompanied with a essay-length description of why other people shouldn’t buy your product. It gets even worse when the problems they describe are something you can fix, but that doesn’t stop the customer from being angry.

In order to avoid a giant, one-star stain defacing your product page for the rest of time, your number one priority is to act quickly.

Think back to the worst customer service experience you’ve ever had. I’ll bet that up there in the list of ‘things that made it the worst’ was the speed, or the complete lack thereof. Slow customer service is one of the most infuriating features of the 21st century, and it can lose you customers very quickly.

Therefore, one of the most important aspects of being a successful Amazon seller is to respond to customer complaints quickly and efficiently. Staying on top of your Amazon reviews, however, can be difficult when you need to manually check all your products, all the time.

In order to help you become the fastest problem-solver in Amazon’s history and turn all your negative reviews into beaming 5-star stories of your quickness and courtesy in solving their problems, we at Efficient Era have developed the Review Notifications system, for product and seller reviews alike.

It works very simply: an automated service will send you an email every time you receive a product or seller review. For each review, the email will contain the star rating, the SKU of the item, the order ID, the date, the reviewer’s screen name, links to the order and the review, and the text that the reviewer wrote.

Thanks to the links, it is easy to respond to any reviews describing a problem. The service can just as easily be used to check on good reviews and note what your customers are pleased with. Harness all of the information you can get from reviews from the comfort of your inbox!
