    <h2>VAT Tool</h2>
    <p>Expanding your market overseas is a great step towards growing your business, but the ramifications can be daunting. Selling globally requires a lot of extra steps. One such step: value added tax (VAT).</p>
    <p>Sending VAT invoices is necessary for any international sales to countries where a VAT is collected instead of a sales tax. Thankfully, we at Efficient Era have created a tool to ease the process of creating and sending VAT invoices to customers.</p>
    <p>The VAT tool pulls data directly from Amazonâ€™s API based on the Amazon Order ID to automatically create the invoice using accurate data regarding the sale, including pricing, SKU, tax (of course) and all other important information. It will then send the invoice to the customer without any additional action required by the seller.</p>
